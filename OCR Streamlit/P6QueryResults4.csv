<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant.

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in since it converted each character into is a byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse every two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

I've been given a database with nearly 300 tables in it and I need to turn this into a MySQL database.

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from <code>6.5</code> to <code>2005</code>?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading <code>6.5</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>Should I forget about the native <code>SQL Server</code> upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch?</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>'s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s standalone <code>""Import and Export Data""</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.  A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the <code>6.5 database</code> are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything.

<p>When it comes to asynchronous programming, a C interface is not enough and we rely on COM controls to fire events to VB6.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I register the control in VB6, VB loads this control in memory and does not unload it until I quit the VB6 IDE. As the control is loaded the whole time, I am unable to recompile it in VC6, because the DLL file is locked.</p>

<p>A solution I found is not to enable the control in VB but use the <code>CreateObject()</code> with the full name of my control. The problem then is that I must declare my control as an Object because VB6 knows nothing of the interface I am using and I do not have access to IntelliSense, which is a pain.</p>

If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

"1069","<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

"1131","<p>Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well.</p>

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the ""No Setup, Just Extract and Run"" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>

"1145","<p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a <code>char *</code>, which has been allocated using <code>malloc()</code>.  It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;

    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {

        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }

        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

"1528","<p>I'm looking for some way to effectively hide inherited members. I have a library of classes which inherit from common base classes.  Some of the more recent descendant classes inherit dependency properties which have become vestigial and can be a little confusing when using <em>IntelliSense</em> or using the classes in a visual designer.</p>

<p>These classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either WPF or Silverlight 2.0.  I know about <code>ICustomTypeDescriptor</code> and <code>ICustomPropertyProvider</code>, but I'm pretty certain those can't be used in Silverlight.  </p>

<p>It's not as much a functional issue as a usability issue.  What should I do?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Some of the properties that I would really like to hide come from ancestors that are not my own and because of a specific tool I'm designing for, I can't do member hiding with the <code>new</code> operator.  (I know, it's ridiculous)</p>

"1535","<p>I've never been completely happy with the way exception handling works, there's a lot exceptions and try/catch brings to the table (stack unwinding, etc.), but it seems to break a lot of the OO model in the process.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the problem:</p>

<p>Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic.</p>

<p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10));
bool success = false;
while (!success)
{
    try
    {
        // do some file IO which may succeed or fail
        success = true;
    }
    catch (IOException e)
    {
        if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout)
        {
            throw e;
        }
        fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods:</p>

<pre><code>this.RetryFileIO( delegate()
    {
        // some code block
    } );
</code></pre>

<p>I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem.</p>

From the UI perspective, the DataContext is a design of the sections of your database that you would like to expose to through LinqToSql and is integral in setting up the ORM features of LinqToSql.</p>

<p>My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.</p>

"2328","<p>I have a problem with maintaining state in an ASP.NET AJAX page. Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. </p>

<p>This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain:</p>

<p>I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (""OnColumnMoved"" or ""OnRowMoved"").</p>

<p>ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked.</p>

<p>However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the <em>original</em> state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page &amp; control are built back up again to reflect the <em>first</em> state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved.</p>

<p>This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side.</p>

<p>And finally &amp; most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change.</p>

<p>So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired.</p>

<p>I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the <code>IDisposable</code> interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the <code>isDisposed</code> property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part?</p>

"2872","<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a main processing thread (non GUI), and be able to spin off GUIs in their own background threads as needed, and having my main non GUI thread keep working. Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common <code>IComponent</code> interface with a single method <code>DoStuff()</code>.</p>

<p>Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of <code>IComponent</code>. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component.</p>

<p>The lifetime of the complete system looks like this</p>

<ol>
<li>Application starts.</li>
<li>Check configuration file for components to load. Load them.</li>
<li><strong>For each component, run <code>DoStuff()</code> to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads.</strong></li>
<li>Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code>. It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4.</p>

<p>It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>When a component tries to fire up a GUI in <code>DoStuff()</code> (the exact line of code is when the component runs <code>Application.Run(theForm)</code>), the component and hence our system ""hangs"" at the <code>Application.Run()</code> line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComponent1: IComponent
{
    public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database  }
}

public class MyComponent2: IComponent
{
    public void DoStuff()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new Form());

        // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI 
        // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed.</p>

<pre><code>public void DoStuff()
{
    new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start()
}

private void ThreadedInitialize()
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();

Should I be listing a related <code>PeerGroup</code> implementing object here with a <em>GUID</em> in <code>net.jxta.platform.Module</code>? As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the <em>GUID</em> is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a <code>PeerGroup</code> object to the group but this new method using <code>META-INF</code> seems to be a lot easier to manage.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for <code>PeerGroup</code> implementation? Also, some general information on the <code>META-INF.services</code> mechanism in Java would be helpful.</p>

"2970","<p>My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.</p>

<p>I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): <a href=""http://www.98hs.ru/js.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.98hs.ru/js.js</a> &lt;-- <strong>TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.</strong></p>

<p>So I commented it out for now. It turns out his FTP password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).</p>

<p>I did a <a href=""http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru"" rel=""noreferrer"">whois on 98hs.ru</a> and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...</p>

<p>I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to <em>do</em> sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?</p>

"3260","<p>We use a data acquisition card to take readings from a device that increases its signal to a peak and then falls back to near the original value.

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system.

<ul>
<li>Data is retrieved from external webservices</li>
<li>Data is stored in SQL 2005</li>
<li>Data is manipulated via a web GUI</li>
<li>The windows service that communicates with the web services has no coupling with our internal web UI, except via the database.</li>
<li>Communication with the web services needs to be both time-based, and triggered via user intervention on the web UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current (pre-pre-production) model for web service communication triggering is via a database table that stores trigger requests generated from the manual intervention.  I do not really want to have multiple trigger mechanisms, but would like to be able to populate the database table with triggers based upon the time of the call.  As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters.  One being ""Is this time-based or manually added?"" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined).  If it is a manaully created trigger, mark it as processed when the trigger has been fired, but not if it is a timed trigger.<br>
<em>or</em><br>
2) Create a second windows service that creates the triggers on-the-fly at timed intervals.</p>

<p>The second option seems like a fudge to me, but the management of option 1 could easily turn into a programming nightmare (how do you know if the last poll of the table returned the event that needs to fire, and how do you then stop it re-triggering on the next poll)</p>

<p>I'd appreciate it if anyone could spare a few minutes to help me decide which route (one of these two, or possibly a third, unlisted one) to take.</p>

<p>So, I decided to block users based on the value of <code>HTTP_REFERER</code>. After all, if the user is navigating inside the site, it will have an appropriate <code>HTTP_REFERER</code>. Well, that was what I thought. </p>

<p>I implemented a rewrite rule in the .htaccess file that says: </p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on 

# Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mywebaddress(.cl)?/.* [NC]
RewriteRule (servlet1|servlet2)/.+\?.+ - [F]
</code></pre>

<p>I expected to forbid access to users that didn't navigate the site but issue direct GET requests to the ""servlet1"" or ""servlet2"" servlets using querystrings. But my expectations ended abruptly because the regular expression <code>(servlet1|servlet2)/.+\?.+</code> didn't worked at all. </p>

<p>I was really disappointed when I changed that expression to <code>(servlet1|servlet2)/.+</code> and it worked so well that my users were blocked no matter if they navigated the site or not. </p>

<p>So, my question is: How do I can accomplish this thing of not allowing ""robots"" with direct access to certain pages if I have no access/privileges/time to modify the application?</p>

"3544","<p>Generally when I use ClickOnce when I build a VB.NET program but it has a few downsides. I've never really used anything else, so I'm not sure
what my options are.</p>

<p>Downsides to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files.</li>
<li>You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet)</li>
<li>Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pros to ClickOnce:</p>

<ul>
<li>It works. Magically. And it's built
into VisualStudio 2008 express.</li>
<li>Makes it easy to upgrade the
application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option.</p>

The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.</p>

<p>What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:</p>

"3739","<p>I have an unusual situation in which I need a SharePoint timer job to both have local administrator windows privileges and to have <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges.</p>

<p>I can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administrators. I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives SharePoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my SharePoint timer job to run <code>stsadm</code>.</p>

<p>Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges which I also need for this SharePoint job. It turns out that <code>SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> won't work in this case. Reflector shows that <code>RunWithElevatedPrivileges</code> checks if the current process is <code>owstimer</code> (the service process which runs SharePoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under <code>NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService</code> windows account which which has <code>SHAREPOINT\System</code> SharePoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job).</p>

<p>The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual NetworkService windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password.</p>

<p>It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment. Stsamd is failing with the following error popup (!) (Winternals filemon shows that stsadm is running under the administrator in this case):</p>

<p><code>The application failed to initialize properly (0x0c0000142).</code> <br />
<code>Click OK to terminate the application.</code></p>

<p>Event Viewer registers nothing except the popup.</p>

One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Let's say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume it's a ""lost packet"" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate).</p>

I am using the .net <code>HttpListener</code> class, but I won't be running this application on IIS and am not using ASP.net.

<p>The class documentation describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) --- none of them refer to SSL.  It does say that if <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate</a>.  Is this going to be a one line property setting and <code>HttpListener</code> figures out the rest?  </p>

<p>In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL.</p>

<p>Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is ""Schannel"" and the content of the message is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fatal error occurred when attempting
  to access the SSL server credential
  private key. The error code returned
  from the cryptographic module is
  0x80090016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit:<br>
<strong>Steps taken so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. ""<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>""</li>
<li>Created a certificate using makecert.exe</li>
<li>Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe</li>
<li>Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090)</li>
<li>Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(<a href=""https://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"");</li>
<li>tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8089/foldername/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8089/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive correct return</li>
<li>tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (<a href=""http://localhost:8090/foldername/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8090/foldername/</a>"") in a browser and receive ""Data Transfer Interrupted"" (in Firefox)</li>
<li>debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier.</li>
<li>netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP.  the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted.</li>

<li>What could the problem be? </li>
<li>Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done)</li>
<li>Have a missed a configuration step somewhere? </li>
<li>What else might I do to analyze the problem?</li>
<li>Is the error message in the System Event log a sign of the problem?  If so how would it be fixed?</li>

"4157","<p>I plan to be storing all my config settings in my application's app.config section (using the <code>ConfigurationManager.AppSettings</code> class). As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the <code>AppSettings</code>. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the <code>AppSettings</code> constantly.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using <code>AppSettings</code> is supposed to be ""the right way"" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read).</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I should probably clarify a few points.</p>

<p>This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application.</p>

<p>According to the MSDN documention, the <code>ConfigurationManager</code> is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I accepted lomaxx's answer because <code>Properties</code> does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits.</p>

<p>Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will <em>ever</em> even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance.</p>

So with autoboxing, I would expect the above to convert myInt to an Integer and then call toString() on that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe C# allows such a call, unless I remember incorrectly.  Is this just an unfortunate shortcoming of Java's autoboxing/unboxing specification, or is there a good reason for this?</p>

when the disk with the SQL Server databases and search index ran out

not resolve the issue. So rather than restoring the VM, we decided to
try to fix the issue.</p>

the new SSP. The old SSP and it's databases were then deleted. Search

fine otherwise. MySites also works OK.</p>

<p><strong>Edit on question:</strong></p>

<p>The query is failing silently with no errors messages logged, and does not occur inside of a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Final Solution:</strong></p>

<p>I never was able to solve the problem, however what I wound up doing was switching to MySQL and using a transactional level query here. This was not the main or even a primary reason to switch. I had been having problems with SQL Server and it allowed me to have our CMS and various other tools all running on the same database. Previous we had a SQL Server and a MySQL database running to run our site.

So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

"5328","<p>So, in Java, the first line of your constructor HAS to be a call to super... be it implicitly calling super(), or explicitly calling another constructor.  What I want to know is, why can't I put a try block around that?</p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public MyClassMock() {
        try {
            super(0);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>But Java complains that super isn't the first statement.</p>

<p>My workaround:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClassMock extends MyClass {
    public static MyClassMock construct() {
        try {
            return new MyClassMock();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

    public MyClassMock() throws Exception {
        super(0);
    }

    // Mocked methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the best workaround?  Why doesn't Java let me do the former?</p>

<hr>

<p>My best guess as to the ""why"" is that Java doesn't want to let me have a constructed object in a potentially inconsistent state... however, in doing a mock, I don't care about that.  It seems I should be able to do the above... or at least I know that the above is safe for my case... or seems as though it should be anyways.</p>

I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. 
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br />
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach.

<p>I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web <code>PLSQL</code> code.

"5831","<p>Does anyone have, or know of, a binary patch generation algorithm implementation in C#?</p>

<p>Basically, compare two files (designated <em>old</em> and <em>new</em>), and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the <em>old</em> file to have the same contents as the <em>new</em> file.</p>

<p>The implementation would have to be relatively fast, and work with huge files. It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>

<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>

<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>

<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>

<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>
<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>
<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>
<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>
<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>
<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>
<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>
</ol>

<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>

<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>

<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>

<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>

<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>

<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>

<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems. I don't know how to resolve that so for the time being just accept the certificate.</p>

<p>The source uses lots of other types from the rest of my library so that file isn't all it takes, but that's the algorithm implementation.</p>

<hr>

<p>@lomaxx, I have tried to find a good documentation for the algorithm used in subversion, called xdelta, but unless you already know how the algorithm works, the documents I've found fail to tell me what I need to know.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I'm just dense... :)</p>

<p>I took a quick peek on the algorithm from that site you gave, and it is unfortunately not usable. A comment from the binary diff file says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finding an optimal set of differences requires quadratic time relative to the input size, so it becomes unusable very quickly.</p>

<p>My needs aren't optimal though, so I'm looking for a more practical solution.</p>

<p>And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also ""leaks"" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information.

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1
</code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the <code>Tvdb()</code> class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended <code>Dict()</code> that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if <code>x[3][24]</code> was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception).</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes: <code>ShowContainer</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Season</code> and <code>Episode</code>. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the <code>search()</code> function on <code>Show()</code> for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code>.</p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's <code>self.data</code> dict, if not, <code>raise season_not_found</code>. I can also check in <code>Season()</code> if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code> functions, it's easy to accidentally recursively call <code>__getitem__</code> (so I'm not sure if extending the <code>Dict</code> class will cause problems).</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old <code>Dict</code> method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See <code>_setItem</code> and <code>_setData</code>. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly... Elegant.</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the <code>ShowContainer</code>/etc classes with <code>Dict</code> cause problems?</p>

<p>So, the question is; In order to do the ""right thing"" should I wrap such VS designer components or objects in a Getter and/or Setter?</p>

<p>I agree with you that in 5 years time it'll probably be impossible to recreate the exact OS and tool configuration (down to the nearest security update).  Unfortunately this really comes from a contractual requirement.  As part of our deliverable to a customer we must provide a copy of all source code and clear instructions on exactly how to replicate the build.

<p>There is no ""Company"" table, I will have to generate the Company Name list from the most descriptive or best Location Name that represents the multiple locations.</p>

<p>Currently I am thinking I need to generate a list of Location Names that are similar, and then and go through that list by hand.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how I can approach this is appreciated.</p>

"6113","<p>The application my team is currently developing has a DLL that is used to perform all database access.  The application can not use a trusted connection because the database is behind a firewall and the domain server is not.  So it appears that the connection string needs to have a DB username and password.  The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open.</p>

<p>One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base.</p>

<p>Is there a way to store the password encrypted in such a way we can easily distribute to the entire user base without storing it in the assembly?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who's answered.  I'll try to answer some of the questions back to me...  The data DLL is used by both ASP.NET WebForms and VB.NET WinForms.  I understand that Applications can have their own config files, but I haven't seen anything on config files for DLLs.  Unfortunately, I can't get to the Jon Galloway post at work so I can't judge if that will work.  From a development standpoint, we don't want to use web services inhouse, but may be providing them to third parties sometime next year.  I don't think impersonation will work because we can't authenticate the user through the firewall.  As a user (or former user) can be an attacker, we're keeping it from everyone!</p>

"6371","<p>I've had a hard time trying to find good examples of how to manage database schemas and data between development, test, and production servers.</p>

<p>Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN.</p>

<p>We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build.</p>

<p>We have a test (virtual) server that runs ""release candidates."" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server.</p>

<p>Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy.</p>

<p>If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is ""base"" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables.</p>

<p>This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do <strong><em>you</em></strong> solve it?</p>

<hr>

<p>I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary.

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include ""-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific"", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?

"6440","<p>I've been using a lot of new .NET 3.5 features in the work that I've been doing, lately. The application that I'm building is intended for distribution among consumers who will probably not have the latest version (or perhaps <em>any version</em>) of the .NET framework on their machines.</p>

<p>I went to go <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""noreferrer"">download the .NET 3.5 redistributable package</a> only to find out that it's almost <strong><em>200 MB!</em></strong> This is unacceptable for my application, because it's supposed to be a quick and painless consumer application that installs quickly and keeps a low profile on the user's machine. For users that have .NET 3.5 already installed, our binary downloads have been instantaneous, so far. This 200 MB gorilla will more than quadruple the size of the download. Is there any other option than this redistributable package that I can use to make sure the framework is on the machine that won't take the user out of our ""quick and painless"" workflow? Our target time from beginning of download to finalizing the install is less than two minutes. Is it just not possible for someone who doesn't already have .NET installed?</p>

"6681","<p>I'm still new to the ASP.NET world, so I could be way off base here, but so far this is to the best of my (limited) knowledge!</p>

<p>Let's say I have a standard business object ""Contact"" in the <em>Business</em> namespace. I write a Web Service to retrieve a Contact's info from a database and return it. I then write a client application to request said details.</p>

<p>Now, I also then create a utility method that takes a ""Contact"" and does some magic with it, like <code>Utils.BuyContactNewHat()</code> say. Which of course takes the Contact of type <code>Business.Contact</code>.</p>

<p>I then go back to my client application and want to utilise the <code>BuyContactNewHat</code> method, so I add a reference to my <em>Utils</em> namespace and there it is. However, a problem arises with:</p>

<pre><code>Contact c = MyWebService.GetContact(""Rob);
Utils.BuyContactNewHat(c); // &lt;&lt; Error Here
</code></pre>

<p>Since the return type of <code>GetContact</code> is of <code>MyWebService.Contact</code> and not <code>Business.Contact</code> as expected. I understand why this is because when accessing a web service, you are actually programming against the proxy class generated by the WSDL.</p>

<p>So, is there an ""easier"" way to deal with this type of mismatch? I was considering perhaps trying to create a generic converter class that uses reflection to ensure two objects have the same structure than simply transferring the values across from one to the other.</p>

<p>On a few occasions recently, I've wanted to design and code a Form object that I could plug into several other ""parent"" forms.  My goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several UI components in a particular way, and then be able to use that (both the UI layout and the logic) in more than one place.  I'm certainly willing to use code (rather than the Design View) to load the child form.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.  The class then knows how to operate on the picture, and it assumes that all its expected pieces have been laid out appropriately.  This approach has several downsides, and I'd like something a bit more elegant.</p>

"7084","<p>I've worked on a number of different embedded systems.  They have all used <code>typedef</code>s (or <code>#defines</code>) for types such as <code>UINT32</code>.</p>

<p>This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc.</p>

<p>But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project.</p>

<p>So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types?</p>

<p>EDIT
I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.</p>

<p>With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.</p>

<p>For everything else the types have less importance.<br>

<p>The problem is that the base class property <code>DropDownItems</code> has a 'default' attribute set on it that is a different value (not 50).  As a result, when I drag the control onto a form, the designer file gets an explicit <code>mycontrol.DropDownItems = 50;</code> line.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<p>In my case, I want to verify that an XML structure is serialized to a byte array with the UTF-8 encoding which is of variable character length. As an example, my current ugly procedure is to inject a character known to require two bytes into the structure before serializing, then replacing the two-byte character with an ASCII character and comparing the serialized array lengths. This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.</p>

<p>I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.</p>

"8042","<p>The new extensions in .Net 3.5 allow functionality to be split out from interfaces.</p>

<p>For instance in .Net 2.0</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }

    List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can (in 3.5) become:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IHaveChildren {
    string ParentType { get; }
    int ParentId { get; }
}

public static class HaveChildrenExtension {
    public static List&lt;IChild&gt; GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) {
        //logic to get children by parent type and id
        //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren 
    }
}

<p>This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces.  They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make the code more maintainable and easier to test.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?)</p>

<p>Any other reasons not to regularly use this pattern?</p>

<hr>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on a string is a <code>.SplitToDictionary()</code> - similar to <code>.Split()</code> but taking a key-value delimiter too)</p>

<p>I think there's a whole best practice debate there ;-)</p>

<p>I'm specifically asking here about using extension methods where previously we had interface methods.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies.</p>

<p>It appears that these exception handlers are only triggered downstream of <code>Application.Run</code> or similar (there's a worker thread flavor, can't remember the name.) If you want to truly globally catch a managed exception you do need to install an SEH filter. You're not going to get a <code>System.Exception</code> and if you want a callstack you're going to have to roll your own walker.</p>

<p>In an MSDN forum question on this topic it was suggested to override a sufficiently low-level point of the main MFC thread in a <code>try ... catch (Exception^)</code>.  For instance, <code>CWinApp::Run</code>.  This may be a good solution but I haven't looked at any perf or stability implications.

<p>For example, assuming an easy BPM (beats per minute) of 120, the timer should tick every .5 seconds (or 500 milliseconds).  Using this as the basis for the ticks, however, isn't entirely accurate as .NET only guarantees that your timer will not tick before the elapsed time has passed.</p>

<p>Currently, to get around this for the same 120 BPM example used above, I am setting the ticks to something like 100 milliseconds and only playing the click sound on every 5th timer tick.  This does improve the accuracy quite a bit, but if feels like a bit of a hack.</p>

<p>Currently the programs performing all these tasks are written in <code>C++</code> and they perform quite quickly all on one average server. I'm investigating the possibilities of using a more ""modern"" language that newer graduate programmers are more likely to be familiar with. (Correct memory allocation in <code>C++</code> seems to causes problems with a lot of newer programmers these days)</p>

<p>Based on the brief information provided, would a language such as python provide the required functionality and performance, as well as addressing the memory allocation (and various other <code>C++</code> related) problems which arise?</p>

<p>I like the idea of not needing to compile the programs each time we make a change. I understand that the interpreted languages probably wont hit the same performance we currently get.</p>

<p>Our systems are <code>Linux</code> based which also restrict some options.</p>

<p>Any comments on the functionality and performance available with <code>Python</code> or suggestions of alternative languages would be much appreciated.</p>

"8756","<p>Does anyone have any good starting points for me when looking at making web pages/sites/applications specifically for viewing on the iPhone?</p>

<p>I've looked at templates like the one <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/meet-joe-hewitt.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joe Hewitt</a> has made, and also seen some templates I can purchase, which I haven't done yet.</p>

<p>I figured someone else had already started on this track and decided that I could probably leech on their newfound knowledge :)</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any pointers? I'm well aware of the problem that the more such a template/framework makes a web app look like a native iPhone app, the more likely I'm going to get into trouble because it just isn't, but for now I want a framework I can start building on, and then in the process figure out how to make it distinctive enough to be perceived as a web app as well as looking like a native iPhone application.</p>

<p>Specifically I'm looking for features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>stylesheets set up, or pointers to how to do them for iPhone</li>
<li>page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right</li>
<li>the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the <em>page</em> for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To avoid people reading only the question and answering, before reading my other reply, I'll add my clarification for GPL licensing and similar issues here.</p>

<p>The framework I need to use can not be distributed under a license which would require me to license my own project out under a similar license. The GPL family of licenses allows for exceptions regarding library usage, but this won't apply to this since by necessity, the kind of framework I would need to use would be all source code.</p>

<p>The project can easily accomodate commercial libraries.</p>

<p>Also, I don't need a <em>library</em> or a <em>framework</em> as such, example files that look good and aren't overly obfuscated would be welcome as well.</p>

"8790","<p>I have a build script and as part of that script it copies a jar file to a directory, for ease lets call it the utils jar.  the utils jar is built by another build script sitting in another directory.  What im trying to do have my build script run the utils build script so that I can ensure the utils jar is up to date.</p>

<p>So I know I need to import the utils build file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;import file=""../utils/build/build.xml"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which doesn't work because the import task, unlike almost every other ant taks, doesn't run from basedir, it runs from the pwd.  So to get around that I have this little ditty, which does successfully import the build file</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property name=""baseDirUpOne"" location="".."" /&gt;
  &lt;import file=""${baseDirUpOne}/utils/build/build.xml"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So now that ive solved my import problem I need to call the task, well that should be easy right:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;antcall target=""utils.package"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>note that in the above, utils is the project name of ../utils/build/build.xml</em></p>

<p>the problem I'm now running into is that ant call doesn't execute in ../utils/build so what I need, and cant find, is a runat property or something similar, essentially:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;antcall target=""utils.package"" runat=""../utils/build"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I need this is that in my utils build file the step to select which code to copy to the jar is based on relative paths so as to avoid hardcoding paths in my ant file. Any ideas? </p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't ""trust"" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide ""Enterprise Level"" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down. Oh well... till next time.</p>

"8939","<p>I'm having trouble connecting (via the Socket and XMLSocket classes) to a TCP listener after a connect timeout.</p>

<p>I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>To clarify and/or summarize:</p>

<p>For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances <strong>within the lifetime of the Flash applet</strong> to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.)</p>

<p>I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying¹ and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail.</p>

<p>My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems <em>it</em> causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly.</p>

<p>I must be missing something very simple.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>1: I know you can't really destroy objects; I just remove all references to them and hope for the best. I haven't tried to explicitly invoke the GC in this case. (Though I think I did try putting the Socket inside an Array and using <em>delete</em>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, it works as expected if the connection is successful (even if the connection drops later on.)</p>

<p>The only event to trigger this is the case when the server doesn't respond at all; it's as if Flash marks the host/port combination as ""offline"" and doesn't bother sending any more packets to it for the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>I suspect an active refusal of the connection (e.g. host is online but not listening to the port) doesn't cause this.</p>

<p>I get no error message or feedback of any other kind from the Socket.</p>

<p>Have you ever called connect() more than once to the same host/port pair, when the first one failed?
How did you know the first connect() failed? And before subsequent connect() calls, did you do anything to reset the socket?</p>

<p>So here is what I did (you'll laugh!):</p>
<h2>Code added to the generic class</h2>
<pre><code>bool TypeValid()
{
    // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type
    TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType));

    // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types
    // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null).
    // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time)
    // all we need to check for is Object!
    switch (code)
    {
        case TypeCode.Object:
            return false;
        default:
            return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception,</p>
<pre><code>private void EnforcePrimitiveType()
{
    if (!TypeValid())
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            &quot;Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '&quot; + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + 
            &quot;' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All that then needs to be done is to call <em>EnforcePrimitiveType()</em> in the classes constructors. Job done! :-)</p>
<p>The only one downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time.. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"" rel=""noreferrer"">FxCop</a> (which we don't use at work).</p>

<p>However, this doesn't work because the @Test annotation will try to make a bunch of methods into tests, and warnings/errors pop up in eclipse when the tests are run.</p>

<pre><code>@Test(enabled = false, groups = { ""db-test"" })

<p>but then any @BeforeTest (and other similar annotations) ALSO get disabled... which is of course not what I want.</p>

"9173","<p>My C# project - we'll call it the SuperUI - used to make use of a class from an external assembly. Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the <code>SuperException</code> - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, <code>SuperAssembly.DLL</code>, which I referenced.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all <code>SuperExceptions</code> with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.</p>

<p>Now, here's the thing:</p>

<ol>
<li>All uses of <code>SuperException</code> have been eliminated from the project's code.</li>
<li>Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, I only reference one more assembly - and <code>that</code> references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw <code>SuperExceptions</code>, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!</li>
<li>I've done Visual Studio's ""Clean Solution"" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not the end of the world to include this reference, I just don't see why it's necessary any more. Nrrrgg. Any pointers welcome!</p>

"9191","<p>I'd like to ask a question then follow it up with my own answer, but also see what answers other people have.</p>

<p>We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>

<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>

<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>

<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>

<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>

<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>

"9240","<p>Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>

<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>

<p>I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? </p>

<p>Looking through the solutions, I see a couple which solve the general problem of keeping a remote directory in sync with a local directory <em>manually</em>. I know that I can set a cron task to run rsync every minute, and this should be fairly close to real time. </p>

<p>This is not the exact solution I was looking for as winscp does this and more: it detects file changes in a directory (while I work on them) and then automatically pushes the changes to the remote server. I know this is not the best solution (no code repository), but it allows me to very quickly test code on a server while I develop it. Does anyone know how to combine rsync with any other commands to get this functionality?</p>

<p>I know this is more a philosophical/subjective questions, but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five lines of code for each field? My personal gripe is that those properties are hiding stuff from me, and I am not a big fan of black magic.</p>

<p>In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway.</p>

<p>I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (one vs six lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field ""Public string Title"" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.</p>

There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - <a href=""http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""excanvas"">excanvas</a>, <a href=""http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx"" rel=""noreferrer"">GFX of Dojo Toolkit</a> and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.</p>

<p>So the question actually consists of several parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?</li>
<li>If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.</li>
<li>The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.</li>
<li>Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.</li>
<li>I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library <a href=""http://www.degrafa.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Degrafa</a>. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by ""Windows lock-in"" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one <em>is able to</em> launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along.  It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it ""under the covers"" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li>

Well, I can only presume this as the numbers listed in the profiler are way short of the maximum allowed (32mb on CE 5). Profiling a particular app with the RPM showed me that the total usage of all the caches only manages to get to about 12mb and then slowly shrinks as (I assume) something unmanaged starts to claim more memory.
The memory slider in System also shows that the device is very short on memory. If I kill the process the slider shows all the memory coming back. So it must (?) be this managed process that is swallowing the memory.</p>

<p>Is there any simple(ish?) fashion how one can track unmanaged memory usage in some way that might enable me to match it up with the corresponding P/Invoke calls?</p>

"10323","<p>I recently read a nice <a href=""http://macdevelopertips.com/ruby/using-a-string-as-a-file-in-ruby.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">post</a> on using <code>StringIO</code> in Ruby.  What the author doesn't mention, though, is that <code>StringIO</code> is just an ""I.""  There's no ""O.""  You <em>can't</em> do this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>s = StringIO.new
s &lt;&lt; 'foo'
s &lt;&lt; 'bar'
s.to_s
# =&gt; should be ""foo\nbar""
# =&gt; really is ''`
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby really needs a StringBuffer just like the one Java has. StringBuffers serve two important purposes. First, they let you test the output half of what Ruby's StringIO does. Second, they are useful for building up long strings from small parts -- something that Joel reminds us over and over again is otherwise very very slow.</p>

<p>Is there a good replacement?</p>

<p>It's true that Strings in Ruby are mutable, but that doesn't mean we should always rely on that functionality.  If <code>stuff</code> is large, the performance and memory requirements of this, for example, is really bad.</p>

<pre><code>result = stuff.map(&amp;:to_s).join(' ')
</code></pre>

<p>The ""correct"" way to do this in Java is:</p>

<pre><code>result = StringBuffer.new("""")

"10670","<p>We have a remoting singleton server running in a separate windows service (let's call her RemotingService). The clients of the RemotingService are ASP.NET instances (many many).</p>

<p>Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164128.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this msdn article</a>, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC.

"10808","<p>Ok, so I've been refactoring my code in my little Rails app in an effort to remove duplication, and in general make my life easier (as I like an easy life).  Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around.  The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document.  So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO).</p>

<p>The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the <strong>after_initialize</strong> hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins.</p>

<p>The problem I have, is that I can have an <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a <strong>super</strong> call at the start to make sure the other mixin <strong><code>after_initialize</code></strong> calls get called.  Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call.</p>

<p>Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough:</p>

<pre><code>class Iso &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by                :customer
  order_lines             :despatched # Mixin

  tracks_serial_numbers   :items  # Mixin

  sendable :customer                      # Mixin

  attr_accessor :address

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a <strong>super</strong> call, how can I stop that last <strong>super</strong> call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it?</p>

"10860","<p>I am in the middle of a ""discussion"" with a colleague about the best way to implement the data layer in a new application.</p>

<p>One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  </p>

<p>The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)</p>

<p>I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.</p>

<p>My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  </p>

<p>Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  </p>

"10870","<p>Once I've called <code>DragManager.acceptDrag</code> is there any way to ""unaccept"" the drag? Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</code></pre>

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

Some of this code is older than me (originally written in the late 70s) and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6.</p>

<p>However, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors', and that something needs to be done.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins.</p>

<p>I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future.</p>

<p>The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net...</p>

<p>I am working my way through some excercises in a book for study, and this particular exercise is User Controls. I have cobbled together a control and would like to set the DefaultEvent for it (having done this for previous controls) so when I double-click it, the default event created is whatever I specify it to be. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a standard User Control (.ascx), <em>NOT</em> a custom rendered control.</p>

<p>Here is the class &amp; event definition:</p>

{
    public event EventHandler OKClicked;

    {

    }

"11288","<p>So WPF doesn't support standard sorting or filtering behavior for views of CompositeCollections, so what would be a best practice for solving this problem. </p>

<p>There are two or more object collections of different types. You want to combine them into a single sortable and filterable collection (withing having to manually implement sort or filter).</p>

<p>One of the approaches I've considered is to create a new object collection with only a few core properties, including the ones that I would want the collection sorted on, and an object instance of each type. </p>

<pre><code>class MyCompositeObject
{
    enum           ObjectType;
    DateTime       CreatedDate;
    string         SomeAttribute;
    myObjectType1  Obj1;
    myObjectType2  Obj2;
{
class MyCompositeObjects : List&lt;MyCompositeObject&gt; { }
</code></pre>

<p>And then loop through my two object collections to build the new composite collection. Obviously this is a bit of a brute force method, but it would work. I'd get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection, and I'd be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item.</p>

"11333","<p>I'm working on a personal project in ASP.NET MVC that I plan on making open source. In the past, I've open-sourced quite a few PHP scripts and UNIX-based stuff. For those, I typically went with a BSD/Apache style license, unless I was including a library that prevented it. On the Linux/PHP side of things, that usually meant something that was GPL-ed, thus still resulting in a fairly clear-cut arrangement.</p>

<p>For this project, however, I'm trying to figure out which licenses are even <strong>possible</strong> to apply to this project and not finding any good resource to answer the question. I know that the only ""real"" answer to this question would involve a lawyer. However, as this isn't something that's going to generate revenue, if I'm going to kick in $1000 toward the project, I'd rather hire a graphic designer or a usability expert to take a pass at the application than pay a lawyer.</p>

<p>This particular project also uses Subsonic for database access and Argotic for RSS parsing, further complicating the issue. </p>

<p>I know that I'm allowed to use all of those pieces and that I can redistribute my project that uses them all. However, what I'm left with is confusion over what the resulting project can/must be licensed under.</p>

<p>I can probably negotiate my way through the maze for the Subsonic and Argotic bits because they're already under open source licenses, but I can't be the only one trying to figure out what license I can apply to a project I write on top of ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>In response to the comments:</p>

<p>I'm not ""scared"" of anything. I'm just attempting to put the same care into the licensing and distribution of this eventual application that I am into the architecture and development of it. Beyond that, I've watched lives ruined because of not paying attention to the arguably byzantine intellectual property laws on the books today.</p>

<p>And, quite frankly, I've actually gotten a nasty letter in the past from the lawyer of an open source component that I included in an <strong>open source</strong> project of my own, but used a license that they weren't happy with.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ""an open-source license"" isn't any more specific in legal terms than saying, ""just use a web programming language and you'll be fine"". GPL is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that, on the face of it, can't be applied to ASP.NET MVC applications. I'm curious if there <strong>is</strong> an existing license that can actually be ""compiled"" with the other licenses of the components I'm using without throwing a legal ""compiler"" error.</p>

<p>I'm not saying the answer is simple (it's not). I asked the question because I'm genuinely interested in an answer that comes from a perspective of having examined the issue closely. When I initially posted it, I fully expected it to sit unanswered for a long time because it's not a simple question.</p>

        MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
        CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, algorithm.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write);
        cs.Write(clearBytes, 0, clearBytes.Length);

"11854","<p>In a project our team is using object lists to perform mass operations on sets of data that should all be processed in a similar way.  In particular, different objects would ideally act the same, which would be very easily achieved with polymorphism.  The problem I have with it is that inheritance implies the <em>is a</em> relationship, rather than the <em>has a</em> relationship.  For example, several objects <em>have a</em> damage counter, but to make this easy to use in an object list, polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an <em>is a</em> relationship which wouldn't be true.  (A person <em>is not a</em> damage counter.)</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of is to have a member of the class return the proper object type when implicitly casted instead of relying on inheritance.  Would it be better to forgo the <em>is a</em> / <em>has a</em> ideal in exchange for ease of programming?</p>

<p>Edit:
To be more specific, I am using C++, so using polymorphism would allow the different objects to ""act the same"" in the sense that the derived classes could reside within a single list and be operated upon by a virtual function of the base class.

<p>We have made several attempts at building unit tests around some of our key stored procedures (primarily testing the performance), but have found that setting up the test data for these tests is really hard.

<blockquote>
  <p>As an example of polymorphism in
  action, let's look at the classic
  ""eval"" interview question, which (as
  far as I know) was brought to Amazon
  by Ron Braunstein. The question is
  quite a rich one, as it manages to
  probe a wide variety of important
  skills: OOP design, recursion, binary
  trees, polymorphism and runtime
  typing, general coding skills, and (if
  you want to make it extra hard)
  parsing theory.</p>
  
  <p>At some point, the candidate hopefully
  realizes that you can represent an
  arithmetic expression as a binary
  tree, assuming you're only using
  binary operators such as ""+"", ""-"",
  ""*"", ""/"". The leaf nodes are all
  numbers, and the internal nodes are
  all operators. Evaluating the
  expression means walking the tree. If
  the candidate doesn't realize this,
  you can gently lead them to it, or if
  necessary, just tell them.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you tell them, it's still an
  interesting problem.</p>
  
  <p>The first half of the question, which
  some people (whose names I will
  protect to my dying breath, but their
  initials are Willie Lewis) feel is a
  Job Requirement If You Want To Call
  Yourself A Developer And Work At
  Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The
  question is: how do you go from an
  arithmetic expression (e.g. in a
  string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an
  expression tree. We may have an ADJ
  challenge on this question at some
  point.</p>
  
  <p>The second half is: let's say this is
  a 2-person project, and your partner,
  who we'll call ""Willie"", is
  responsible for transforming the
  string expression into a tree. You get
  the easy part: you need to decide what
  classes Willie is to construct the
  tree with. You can do it in any
  language, but make sure you pick one,
  or Willie will hand you assembly
  language. If he's feeling ornery, it
  will be for a processor that is no
  longer manufactured in production.</p>
  
  <p>You'd be amazed at how many candidates
  boff this one.</p>
  
  <p>I won't give away the answer, but a
  Standard Bad Solution involves the use
  of a switch or case statment (or just
  good old-fashioned cascaded-ifs). A
  Slightly Better Solution involves
  using a table of function pointers,
  and the Probably Best Solution
  involves using polymorphism. I
  encourage you to work through it
  sometime. Fun stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let's try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression (e.g. in a string) such as ""2 + (2)"" to an expression tree using cascaded-if's, a table of function pointers, and/or polymorphism?  </p>

<p>Feel free to tackle one, two, or all three.</p>

When wsdl.exe is run, it will automatically create proxy classes that contain just the data portion, and these will be automatically converted to and from my real business objects on the server side.  On the client side, they will only get to use the dumb proxy type, and they will have to map them into some real business objects as they see fit.  A big drawback here is that if I ""own"" both the server and client side, and I want to use the same set of real business objects, I can run into certain headaches with name conflicts, etc.  (Since the real objects and the proxies are named the same.)</p></li>
<li><p>Forget trying to pass ""real"" business objects.  Instead, just create simple DataTransfer objects which I will map back and forth to my real business objects manually.  They still get copied to new proxy objects by wsdl.exe anyway, but at least I'm not tricking myself into thinking that web services can natively handle objects with business logic in them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By the way - Does anyone know how to tell wsdl.exe to <em>not</em> make a copy of the object?  Shouldn't we be able to just tell it, ""Hey, use this existing type right over here. Don't copy it!""</p>

"13348","<p>In a database-centric application that is designed for multiple clients, I've always thought it was ""better"" to use a single database for ALL clients - associating records with proper indexes and keys.  In listening to the Stack Overflow podcast, I heard Joel mention that FogBugz uses one database per client (so if there were 1000 clients, there would be 1000 databases).  What are the advantages of using this architecture?</p>

<p>I understand that for some projects, clients need direct access to all of their data - in such an application, it's obvious that each client needs their own database.  However, for projects where a client does not need to access the database directly, are there any advantages to using one database per client?  It seems that in terms of flexibility, it's much simpler to use a single database with a single copy of the tables.  It's easier to add new features, it's easier to create reports, and it's just easier to manage.</p>

<p>I was pretty confident in the ""one database for all clients"" method until I heard Joel (an experienced developer) mention that his software uses a different approach -- and I'm a little confused with his decision...</p>

<p>I've heard people cite that databases slow down with a large number of records, but any relational database with some merit isn't going to have that problem - especially if proper indexes and keys are used.</p>

"13485","<p>My current development project has two aspects to it. First, there is a public website where external users can submit and update information for various purposes. This information is then saved to a local SQL Server at the colo facility.</p>

<p>The second aspect is an internal application which employees use to manage those same records (conceptually) and provide status updates, approvals, etc. This application is hosted within the corporate firewall with its own local SQL Server database.</p>

<p>The two networks are connected by a hardware VPN solution, which is decent, but obviously not the speediest thing in the world.</p>

<p>The two databases are similar, and share many of the same tables, but they are not 100% the same. Many of the tables on both sides are very specific to either the internal or external application.</p>

<p>So the question is: when a user updates their information or submits a record on the public website, how do you transfer that data to the internal application's database so it can be managed by the internal staff? And vice versa... how do you push updates made by the staff back out to the website?</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the more ""real time"" these updates occur, the better. Not that it has to be instant, just reasonably quick.</p>

<p>So far, I have thought about using the following types of approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bi-directional replication</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to sync the changes as they are made (in real time).</li>
<li>Web service interfaces on both sides with code to asynchronously sync the changes (using a queueing mechanism).</li>
</ol>

<p>Please forgive me, Joel, for stealing your question.  Joel asked this question on a podcast a while back but I don't think it ever got resolved.  I'm in the same situation, so I'm also looking for the answer.  </p>

<p>I have multiple devices that all sync with MS-Outlook.  PCs, Laptops, Smartphones, PDAs, etc. all have the capability to synchronize their data (calendars, emails, contacts, etc.) with the Exchange server.  I like to use the Outlook meeting notice or appointment reminders to remind me of an upcoming meeting or doctors appointment or whatever.  The problem lies in the fact that all the devices pop up the same reminder and I have to go to every single device individually in order to snooze or dismiss all of the identical the reminder popups.  </p>

<p>Since this is a sync'ing technology, why doesn't the fact that I snooze or dismiss on one device sync up the other devices automatically.  I've even tried to force a sync after dismissing a reminder and it still shows up on my other devices after a forced sync.  This is utterly annoying to me.  </p>

<p>Is there a setting that I'm overlooking or is there a 3rd party reminder utility that I should be using instead of the built-in stuff?</p>

"13537","<p>I've heard of the idea of bootstrapping a language, that is, writing a compiler/interpreter for the language in itself.  I was wondering how this could be accomplished and looked around a bit, and saw someone say that it could only be done by either</p>

<li>writing an initial compiler in a different language.</li>
<li>hand-coding an initial compiler in Assembly, which seems like a special case of the first</li>

insert into myTable (Col1, Col2) values (@col1, @col2)

<p>My logic behind writing it in this way is that the update will perform an implicit select using the where clause and if that returns 0 then the insert will take place.</p>

<p>The alternative to doing it this way would be to do a select and then based on the number of rows returned either do an update or insert. This I considered inefficient because if you are to do an update it will cause 2 selects (the first explicit select call and the second implicit in the where of the update). If the proc were to do an insert then there'd be no difference in efficiency.</p>

"13678","<p>I am part of a high school robotics team, and there is some debate about which language to use to program our robot.  We are choosing between C (or maybe C++) and LabVIEW.  There are pros for each language.</p>

<p>C(++):</p>

<ul>
<li>Widely used</li>
<li>Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)</li>
<li>We can expand upon our C codebase from last year</li>
<li>Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>LabVIEW</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)</li>
<li>Easier to teach (Supposedly...)</li>
<li>""The future of programming is graphical.""  (Think so?)</li>
<li>Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.</li>
<li>Don't need to intimately know what's going on.  Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while.  Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, <strong>what do you think the better option is?</strong> Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.  We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you think that graphical languages such as LabVEIW are the future of programming?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?</strong>  I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.</li>
<li>Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, <strong>how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?</strong>  (""Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code.""  But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the advice!</p>

<p>Edit:
I'd like to emphasize this question more:
The team captain thinks that LabVIEW is better for its ease of learning and teaching.  <strong>Is that true?</strong>  I think that C could be taught just as easily, and beginner-level tasks would still be around with C.  I'd really like to hear your opinions.  <strong>Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a ""while box?""</strong>  <strong>Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?</strong></p>

To me they always represented some ""magic"" that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code.

<p>My main concern now is that I may have a memory leak, since I'm handling the PreviewKeyDown event on UIElements and never explicitly ""unhook"" the event.</p>

<p>What's the best approach to prevent this leak (if indeed there is one)? Should I keep a list of the elements I'm managing, and unhook the PreviewKeyDown event in the Application.Exit event? Has anyone had success with attached behaviours in their own WPF applications and come up with an elegant memory-management solution?</p>

"14087","<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How would you go adding automated testing to a game?</p>

<p>I believe you can unit test a lot of the game engine's functionality (networking, object creation, memory management, etc), but is it possible to automate test the actual game itself?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about gameplay elements (like Protoss would beat Zerg in map X), but I'm talking about the interaction between the game and the engine.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In game development, the engine is just a platform for the game. You could think of the game engine as an OS and the game as a software the OS would run. The game could be a collection of scripts or an actual subroutine inside the game engine.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Answers</strong></p>

<p>My idea is this: </p>

<p>You would need an engine that is deterministic. This means that given one set of input, the output would be exactly the same. This would inlude the random generator being seeded with the same input.</p>

<p>Then, create a bare-bone level which contains a couple of objects the avatar/user can interact with. Start small and then add objects into the level as more interactions are developed.</p>

<p>Create a script which follows a path (tests pathfinding) and interact with the different objects (store the result or expected behavior). This script would be your automated test. After a certain amount of time (say, one week), run the script along with your engine's unit tests.</p>

"14106","<p>A few weeks ago, I was assigned to evaluate all our programmers. I'm very uncomfortable with this since I was the one who taught everyone the shop's programming language (they all got out of college not knowing the language and as luck would have it, I'm very proficient with it.). On the evaluation, I was very biased on their performance (perfect scores).</p>

<p>I'm glad that our programming shop doesn't require an average performance level but I heard horror stories of shops which do require an average level.</p>

<p>My question are as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>As a programmer, what evaluation questions would you like to see?</li>
<li>As a manager, what evaluation questions would you like to see?</li>

# If we get data from arduino, then print it

<p>There doesn't seem to be much of a difference productivity-wise, but doing data binding programmatically seems somewhat less than trivial. I took a look at how the mxml compiler transforms the data binding expressions. The result is a bunch of generated callbacks and a lot more lines than in the mxml representation.

<p>We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>

<p>So, the question is this: For simple data retrievals, which approach is better, LINQ-to-SQL or stored procs? Any specific pro's or con's?</p>

"14582","<p>I've been using Subversion for code control with TortoiseSVN to interface with the server for the past few months, and in general it's been going great!  However, occasionally my FoxPro IDE will change the case of a file extension without warning where ""<em>program.prg</em>"" becomes ""<em>program.<strong>PRG</em></strong>"")  TortoiseSVN apparently takes this to mean the first file was removed, becoming flagged as ""missing"" and the second name comes up as ""non-versioned"", wreaking havoc on my ability to track changes to the file.   I understand that Subversion has it origins in the case-sensitive world of *nix but, is there any way to control this behavior in either Subversion or TortoiseSVN to be file name case-insensitive when used with Windows?</p>

"14614","<p>First off, I understand the reasons why an interface or abstract class (in the .NET/C# terminology) cannot have abstract static methods.  My question is then more focused on the best design solution.</p>

<p>What I want is a set of ""helper"" classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper.RetrieveByID(string id);
AHelper.RetrieveByName(string name);
AHelper.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>Since my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.</p>

<p>I could always make these methods non-static and then instantiate the objects first such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper a = new AHelper();
a.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>However, this code doesn't seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions?  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether (the situation I'm in now) or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design I'm looking for?</p>

<p>I think I may have to actually do some sort of thing where I literally make each combination one by one (with a series of loops) and add up the total ""score"" of each, and find the best one....</p>

<p>EDIT:
To clarify, this isn't a ""homework"" assignment (I'm not in school). It is part of my current project at work.</p>

<p>The requirements (as always) have been constantly changing. If I were given the current constraints at the time I began working on this problem, I would be using some variant of the A* algorithm (or Dijkstra's or shortest path or simplex or something). But everything has been morphing and changing, and that brings me to where I'm at right now.</p>

<p>So I guess that means I need to forget about all the crap I've done to this point and just go with what I know I should go with, which is a path finding algorithm.</p>

"14893","<p>Or, actually establishing a build process when there isn't much of one in place to begin with.</p>

<p>Currently, that's pretty much the situation my group faces.  We do web-app development primarily (but no desktop development at this time).  Software deployments are ugly and unwieldy even with our modest apps, and we've had far too many issues crop up in the two years I have been a part of this team (and company).  It's past time to do something about that, and the upshot is that we'll be able to kill two Joel Test birds with one stone (daily builds and one-step builds, neither of which exists in any form whatsoever).</p>

<p>What I'm after here is some general insight on the kinds of things I need to be doing or thinking about, from people who have been in software development for longer than I have and also have bigger brains.  I'm confident that will be most of the people currently posting in the beta.</p>

<p>Relevant Tools:
Visual Build
Source Safe 6.0 (I know, but I can't do anything about whether or not we use Source Safe at this time.  That might be the next battle I fight.)</p>

<p>Tentatively, I've got a Visual Build project that does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get source and place in local directory, including necessary DLLs needed for project.</li>
<li>Get config files and rename as needed (we're storing them in a special sub directory that isn't part of the actual application, and they are named according to use).</li>
<li>Build using Visual Studio</li>
<li>Precompile using command line, copying into what will be a ""build"" directory</li>
<li>Copy to destination.</li>
<li>Get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents, images, and reports that are associated with the project (and put into directory from step 5).  There's a lot of this stuff, and I didn't want to include it previously.  However, I'm going to only copy changed items, so maybe it's irrelevant.  I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to include this stuff in earlier steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>I still need to coax some logging out of Visual Build for all of this, but I'm not at a point where I need to do that yet.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice or suggestions to make?  We're not currently using a Deployment Project, I'll note.  It would remove some of the steps necessary in this build I presume (like web.config swapping).</p>

"15254","<p>Is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays?</p>

<p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p>

<p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

class A
{
    public:

    A() : data(0) {}
    virtual ~A() {}
    int data;
};

int main()
{
    const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

    char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
    A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

    // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
    printf(""Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n"", pBuffer, pA);

    // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete[] pBuffer;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p>

<p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

<p>Our company has about 20 developers all running Windows XP/Vista and developing primarily for Linux &amp; Solaris.  Until recently we all logged into a main Linux server and modified/built code the good old fashioned way: Emacs, Vi, dtpad - take your pick.  Then someone said, ""hey - we're living in the Dark Ages, we should be using an IDE"".</p>

<p>So we tried out a few and decided that Visual Studio was the only one that would meet our performance needs (yes, I'm sure that IDE X is a very nice IDE, but we chose VS).</p>

<p>The problem is, how do you setup your environment to have the files available locally to VS, but also available to a build server?  We settled with writing a Visual Studio plugin - it writes our files locally and to the build server whenever we hit ""Save"" and we have a bit fat ""sync"" button that we can push when our files change on the server side (for when we update to the latest files from our source control server).  </p>

<p>The plugin also uses Visual Studio's external build system feature that ultimately just ssh's into the build server and calls our local ""make"" utility (which is Boost Build v2 - has great dependency checking, but is <em>really</em> slow to start as a result i.e. 30-60 seconds to begin).  The results are piped back into Visual Studio so the developer can click on the error and be taken to the appropriate line of code (quite slick actually).  The build server uses GCC and cross-compiles all of our Solaris builds.</p>

<p>But even after we've done all this, I can't help but sigh whenever I start to write code in Visual Studio.  I click a file, start typing, and VS chugs to catch up with me.</p>

"15805","<p>The product we are working on allows the user to easily set it up to run automatically whenever the computer is started. This is helpful because the product is part of the basic work environment of most of our users.<br>
This feature was implemented not so long ago and for a while all was well, but when we started testing this feature on Vista the product started behaving really weird on startup. Specifically, our product makes use of another product (lets call it X) that it launches whenever it needs its services. The actual problem is that whenever X is launched immediately after log-on, it crashes or reports critical errors related to disk access (this happens even when X is launched directly - not through our product).</p>

<p>This happens whenever we run our product by registering it in the ""Run"" key in the registry or place a shortcut to it in the ""<em>Startup</em>"" folder inside the ""<em>Start Menu</em>"", even when we put a delay of ~20 seconds before actually starting to run. When we changed the delay to 70 seconds, all is well.</p>

<p>We tried to reproduce the problem by launching our product manually immediately after logon (by double-clicking on a shortcut placed on the desktop) but to no avail.</p>

<p>Now how is it possible that applications that run normally a minute after logon report such hard errors when starting immediately after logon?</p>

<p>IIRC, one of Python's original remits was as a prototyping language, however Python is pretty liberal in allowing functions, functors, objects to be passed to functions and methods, whereas I suspect the same is not true of say C or Fortran.</p>

<p>What should I know about designing functions/classes which I envisage will have to interface into the compiled language? And how much of these potential problems are dealt with by libraries such as cTypes, bgen, <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SWIG</a>, <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Boost.Python</a>, <a href=""http://cython.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cython</a> or <a href=""http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python SIP</a>?</p>

<p>For this particular use case, (a fitting library) I imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions (Guassian, Lorentzian etc.) as Python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library. Passing and returning arrays is also essential.</p>

<p>One of the things I've asked a lot about on this site is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">LINQ</a>. The questions I've asked have been wide and varied and often don't have much context behind them. So in an attempt to consolidate the knowledge I've acquired on Linq I'm posting this question with a view to maintaining and updating it with additional information as I continue to learn about LINQ.</p>

<h2>What is LINQ?</h2>
<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LINQ Project is a codename for a
set of extensions to the .NET
Framework that encompass
language-integrated query, set, and
transform operations. It extends C#
and Visual Basic with native language
syntax for queries and provides class
libraries to take advantage of these
capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that LINQ provides a standard way to query a variety of datasources using a common syntax.</p>
<h2>What flavours of LINQ are there?</h2>

<h2>What do I need to use LINQ?</h2>
<p>Linq is currently available in VB.Net 9.0 and C# 3.0 so you'll need Visual Studio 2008 or greater to get the full benefits. (You could always write your code in notepad and compile using MSBuild)</p>
<p>There is also a tool called <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652/querying-like-linq-when-you-dont-have-linq#7710"">LinqBridge</a> which will allow you to run Linq like queries in C# 2.0.</p>

"16340","<p>Say I have an object that stores a byte array and I want to be able to efficiently generate a hashcode for it. I've used the cryptographic hash functions for this in the past because they are easy to implement, but they are doing a lot more work than they should to be cryptographically oneway, and I don't care about that (I'm just using the hashcode as a key into a hashtable).</p>

<p>Here's what I have today:</p>

<pre><code>struct SomeData : IEquatable&lt;SomeData&gt;
{
    private readonly byte[] data;
    public SomeData(byte[] data)
    {
        if (null == data || data.Length &lt;= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(""data"");
        }
        this.data = new byte[data.Length];
        Array.Copy(data, this.data, data.Length);
    }

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        return obj is SomeData &amp;&amp; Equals((SomeData)obj);
    }

    public bool Equals(SomeData other)
    {
        if (other.data.Length != data.Length)
        {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.Length; ++i)
        {
            if (data[i] != other.data[i])
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return BitConverter.ToInt32(new MD5CryptoServiceProvider().ComputeHash(data), 0);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.</p>

<p>Hi All,<br />
OK, further into my adventures with custom controls...</p>
<p>In summary, here is that I have learned of three main &quot;classes&quot; of custom controls. Please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UserControls</strong> - Which inherit from <em>UserControl</em> and are contained within an <em>ASCX</em> file. These are pretty limited in what they can do, but are a quick and light way to get some UI commonality with designer support.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Composite Controls</strong> - These are controls that inherit from <em>WebControl</em> where you add pre-existing controls to the control within the <em>CreateChildControls</em> method. This provides great flexibility, but lack of designer support without additional coding. They are highly portable though since they can be compiled into a DLL.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Rendered Controls</strong> - Similar to Custom Composite Controls, these are added to a Web Control Library project. The rendering of the control is completely controlled by the programmer by overriding the <em>Render</em> method.</li>
</ol>
<h2>My Thoughts..</h2>
<p>OK, so while playing with custom composites, I found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have little/no control over the HTML output making it difficult to &quot;debug&quot;.</li>
<li>The <em>CreateChildControls</em> (and subsequent methods) can get real busy with <em>Controls.Add(myControl)</em> everywhere.</li>
<li>I found rendering tables (be it for layout or content) to be considerably awkward.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Question(s)..</h2>
<p>So, I admit, I am new to this so I could be way off-base with some of my points noted above..</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you use Composites?</li>
<li>Do you have any neat tricks to control the HTML output?</li>
<li>Do you just say &quot;to hell with it&quot; and go ahead and create a custom rendered control?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Its something I am keen to get really firm in my mind since I know how much <em>good</em> control development can cut overall development time.</strong></p>

<p>OK, following on from my other question on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6681/aspnet-web-service-results-proxy-classes-and-type-conversion"">ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion</a>. I've come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.</p>
<p>Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.</p>
<p>Now, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy class(es) as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.</p>
<p>In this case, that is something that I would really, really, <em>really!</em> like to avoid!</p>
<p>So, it got me thinking, <strong>how else could we do this?</strong></p>
<p>My current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then de-serialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.</p>

"17732","<p>There's a <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/browse_thread/thread/8e0235d58c8635c2"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""assertions: does it matter that they are disabled in production?"">discussion</a> going on over at comp.lang.c++.moderated about whether or not assertions, which in C++ only exist in debug builds by default, should be kept in production code or not.</p>

<p>Obviously, each project is unique, so my question here is <strong>not</strong> so much <strong>whether</strong> assertions should be kept, <strong>but in which cases</strong> this is recommendable/not a good idea.</p>

<p>By assertion, I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>A run-time check that tests a condition which, when false, reveals a bug in the software.</li>
<li>A mechanism by which the program is halted (maybe after really minimal clean-up work).</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not necessarily talking about C or C++.</p>

<p>My own opinion is that if you're the programmer, but don't own the data (which is the case with most commercial desktop applications), you should keep them on, because a failing asssertion shows a bug, and you should not go on with a bug, with the risk of corrupting the user's data. This forces you to test strongly before you ship, and makes bugs more visible, thus easier to spot and fix.</p>

<p>What's your opinion/experience?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hey Graham,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An assertion is error, pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one.
  Since an error should be handled in release mode then you don't really need assertions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's why I prefer the word ""bug"" when talking about assertions. It makes things much clearer. To me, the word ""error"" is too vague. A missing file is an error, not a bug, and the program should deal with it. Trying to dereference a null pointer is a bug, and the program should acknowledge that something smells like bad cheese.</p>

<p>Hence, you should test the pointer with an assertion, but the presence of the file with normal error-handling code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Slight off-topic, but an important point in the discussion.</p>

<p>As a heads-up, if your assertions break into the debugger when they fail, why not. But there are plenty of reasons a file could not exist that are completely outside of the control of your code: read/write rights, disk full, USB device unplugged, etc. Since you don't have control over it, I feel assertions are not the right way to deal with that.</p>

<p>Carl</p>

<hr>

<p>Thomas,</p>

<p>Yes, I have Code Complete, and must say I strongly disagree with that particular advice.</p>

<p>Say your custom memory allocator screws up, and zeroes a chunk of memory that is still used by some other object. I happens to zero a pointer that this object dereferences regularly, and one of the invariants is that this pointer is never null, and you have a couple of assertions to make sure it stays that way. What do you do if the pointer suddenly is null. You just if() around it, hoping that it works?</p>

<p>Remember, we're talking about product code here, so there's no breaking into the debugger and inspecting the local state. This is a real bug on the user's machine.</p>

"17878","<p>Suppose I have two applications written in C#. The first is a third party application that raises an event called ""OnEmailSent"".</p>

<p>The second is a custom app that I've written that I would like to somehow subscribe to the ""OnEmailSent"" even of the first application.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I could somehow attach the second application to an instance of the first application to listen for ""OnEmailSent"" event?</p>

<hr>

<p>So for further clarification, my specific scenario is that we have a custom third party application written in c# that raises an ""OnEmailSent"" event. We can see the event exists using reflector.</p>

<p>What we want to do is have some other actions take place when this component sends an email.</p>

<p>The most efficient way we can think of would be to be able to use some form of IPC as anders has suggested and listen for the OnEmailSent event being raised by the third party component.</p>

<p>Because the component is written in C# we are toying with the idea of writing another C# application that can attach itself to the executing process and when it detect the OnEmailSent event has been raise it will execute it's own event handling code.</p>

<hr>

<p>I might be missing something, but from what I understand of how remoting works is that there would need to be a server defining some sort of contract that the client can subscribe to.</p>

<p>I was more thinking about a scenario where someone has written a standalone application like outlook for example, that exposes events that I would like to subscribe to from another application.</p>

<p>I thought I'd try to accomplish it using javascript and not CSS in an effort to keep the requests for image files to a minimum (yes, I know that it's possible to combine all required rounded corner shapes into one image) and I also wanted to be able to change the background color pretty much on the fly.</p>

<p>I already utilize jQuery so I looked at the excellent <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/corners"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rounded corners plugin</a> and it worked like a charm in every browser I tried. Being a developer however I noticed the opportunity to make it a bit more efficient. The script already includes code for detecting if the current browser supports webkit rounded corners (safari based browsers). If so it uses raw CSS instead of creating layers of divs.</p>

<p>I thought that it would be awesome if the same kind of check could be performed to see if the browser supports the Gecko-specific <code>-moz-border-radius-*</code> properties and if so utilize them.</p>

<p>The check for webkit support looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var webkitAvailable = false;  
try {  
    webkitAvailable = (document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(this[0], null)['-webkit-border-radius'] != undefined);
} 
catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>That, however, did not work for <code>-moz-border-radius</code> so I started checking for alternatives.</p>

<p>My fallback solution is of course to use browser detection but that's far from recommended practice ofcourse.</p>

<p>My best solution yet is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>var mozborderAvailable = false;
try {
    var o = jQuery('&lt;div&gt;').css('-moz-border-radius', '1px');
    mozborderAvailable = $(o).css('-moz-border-radius-topleft') == '1px';
    o = null;
} catch(err) {}
</code></pre>

<p>It's based on the theory that Gecko ""expands"" the composite -moz-border-radius to the four sub-properties</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-topleft</code></li>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-topright</code></li>
<li><code>-moz-border-radius-bottomleft</code></li>

"18655","<p>I really need to see some honest, thoughtful debate on the merits of the currently accepted <strong><em>enterprise application</em></strong> design paradigm.</p>

<p>I am not convinced that entity objects should exist.</p>

<p>By entity objects I mean the typical things we tend to build for our applications, like ""Person"", ""Account"", ""Order"", etc.</p>

<p>My current design philosophy is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>All database access must be accomplished via stored procedures.</li>
<li>Whenever you need data, call a stored procedure and iterate over a SqlDataReader or the rows in a DataTable</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: I have also built enterprise applications with Java EE, java folks please substitute the equvalent for my .NET examples)</p>

<p>I am not anti-OO.  I write lots of classes for different purposes, just not entities.  I will admit that a large portion of the classes I write are static helper classes.</p>

<p>I am not building toys.  I'm talking about large, high volume transactional applications deployed across multiple machines.  Web applications, windows services, web services, b2b interaction, you name it.</p>

<p>I have used OR Mappers.  I have written a few.  I have used the Java EE stack, CSLA, and a few other equivalents.  I have not only used them but actively developed and maintained these applications in production environments.</p>

<p>I have come to the battle-tested conclusion that entity objects are getting in our way, and our lives would be <em>so</em> much easier without them.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example: you get a support call about a certain page in your application that is not working correctly, maybe one of the fields is not being persisted like it should be.  With my model, the developer assigned to find the problem opens <em>exactly 3 files</em>.  An ASPX, an ASPX.CS and a SQL file with the stored procedure.  The problem, which might be a missing parameter to the stored procedure call, takes minutes to solve.  But with any entity model, you will invariably fire up the debugger, start stepping through code, and you may end up with 15-20 files open in Visual Studio.  By the time you step down to the bottom of the stack, you forgot where you started.  We can only keep so many things in our heads at one time.  Software is incredibly complex without adding any unnecessary layers.</p>

<p>Development complexity and troubleshooting are just one side of my gripe.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about scalability.</p>

<p>Do developers realize that each and every time they write or modify any code that interacts with the database, they need to do a throrough analysis of the exact impact on the database?  And not just the development copy, I mean a mimic of production, so you can see that the additional column you now require for your object just invalidated the current query plan and a report that was running in 1 second will now take 2 minutes, just because you added a single column to the select list?  And it turns out that the index you now require is so big that the DBA is going to have to modify the physical layout of your files?</p>

<p>If you let people get too far away from the physical data store with an abstraction, they will create havoc with an application that needs to scale.</p>

<p>I am not a zealot.  I can be convinced if I am wrong, and maybe I am, since there is such a strong push towards Linq to Sql, ADO.NET EF, Hibernate, Java EE, etc.  Please think through your responses, if I am missing something I really want to know what it is, and why I should change my thinking.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Edit]</em></strong></p>

<p>It looks like this question is suddenly active again, so now that we have the new comment feature I have commented directly on several answers.  Thanks for the replies, I think this is a healthy discussion.</p>

<p>I probably should have been more clear that I am talking about enterprise applications.  I really can't comment on, say, a game that's running on someone's desktop, or a mobile app.</p>

<p>One thing I have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers: orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity/ORM.  Stored procedures, to me, are the best example of separation of concerns that I can think of.  If you disallow all other access to the database, other than via stored procedures, you could in theory redesign your entire data model and not break any code, so long as you maintained the inputs and outputs of the stored procedures.  They are a perfect example of programming by contract (just so long as you avoid ""select *"" and document the result sets).</p>

<p>Ask someone who's been in the industry for a long time and has worked with long-lived applications: how many application and UI layers have come and gone while a database has lived on?  How hard is it to tune and refactor a database when there are 4 or 5 different persistence layers generating SQL to get at the data?  You can't change anything!

<p>I would think this would render the DisplayMessage correctly, however, null is being returned.  After a heavy dose of tinkering around, I finally created a ""MessageData"" class in order to strongly type my user control:</p>

<pre><code>public class MessageControl : ViewUserControl&lt;MessageData&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and now this call works:</p>

<pre><code>return View(""Message"", new MessageData() { DisplayMessage = ""This is a test"" });
</code></pre>

<p>and can be displayed like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= ViewData.Model.DisplayMessage %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why wouldn't the DisplayMessage property be added to the ViewData (ie. ViewData[""DisplayMessage""]) collection without strong typing the user control?  Is this by design?  Wouldn't it make sense that ViewData would contain a key for ""DisplayMessage""?</p>

<p>I realise that with <code>apt.conf</code> that you could set <code>chmod 600</code> (which it isn't by default on Ubuntu/Debian!) but on our system there are people who need root priveleges .</p>

<p>I also realise that it is technically impossible to secure a password from someone who has root access, however I was wondering if there was a way of <i>obscuring</i> the password to prevent accidental discovery.

Location: [John's office]  

Date:     [Fri. Aug. 22, 2008]  

Time:     [ 2:00 PM]

[Clear]  [Submit]

============================================================
</pre>

<p>When you click submit, it calls the same AddTask function.</p>

<p>Is this considered:  </p>

<ul>
<li>a good way to code</li>
<li>just for the newbies</li>
<li>horrendous!.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong>  </p>

<p>I'm noticing a trend here for ""shared library called by both the GUI and CLI executables."" Is there some compelling reason why they would have to be separated, other than maybe the size of the binaries themselves? </p>

<p>Why not just call the same executable in different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>""todo /G""</code>  when you want the full-on graphical interface</li>
<li><code>""todo /I""</code>  for an interactive prompt <em>within</em> <code>todo.exe</code> (scripting, etc)</li>
<li>plain old <code>""todo &lt;function&gt;""</code> when you just want to do one thing and be done with it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong>  </p>

<p>It was mentioned that ""the way [I've] described things, you [would] need to spawn an executable every time the GUI needs to do something.""  </p>

<p>Again, this wasn't my intent. When I mentioned that the example GUI called ""the same <code>AddTask</code> function,"" I didn't mean the GUI called the command line program each time. I agree that would be totally nasty. I had intended (see first addendum) that this all be held in a single executable, since it was a tiny example, but I don't think my phrasing necessarily precluded a shared library.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to thank all of you for your input. This is something that keeps popping back in my mind and I appreciate the wisdom of your experience.</p>

I'm using a custom font for report headers, and when deployed to the server it does not render correctly when I print or export to PDF/TIFF. I have installed the font on the server. Is there anything else I need to do in order to use custom fonts?</p>

<p>When viewing the font in the browser it looks correct - since all client computers have the font installed...</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Ryan, your post to the FAQ solved the problem. Installing the fonts on the server fixes the print problem, as well as problems with charts (which are also rendered on the server). Like you point out (as well as being mentioned in the FAQ) Reporting Services 2005 does not do font embedding in PDF files. I guess that is okay for now - the most important part was being able to hit print and get the correct fonts.</p>

<p>The reason the fonts didn't show up straight away is answered in the FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q: I've installed the font on my client/server but I still see ?'s or
  black boxes. Why?</strong> A: For the client
  machine, closing all instances of the
  PDF viewer then reopening them should
  fix the issue.</p>
  
  <p>For the server, restarting the
  services should allow the PDF renderer
  to pick up the new font information.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, I have also seen times
  where I needed a full machine reboot
  to get the client/server to recognize
  the newly installed font.</p>

I have been thinking about how I can ensure all future child classes are serializable to XML.</p>
<p>Now, obviously I could implement the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.ixmlserializable.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">IXmlSerializable</a> interface and then chuck a reader/writer to it but I would like to avoid that since it then means I need to instantiate a reader/writer whenever I want to do it, and 99.99% of the time I am going to be working with a <em>string</em> so I may just write my own.</p>
<p>However, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the <em>Xml???</em> attributes ( <em>XmlRoot</em> , <em>XmlElement</em> etc.) and then passing it to the <em>XmlSerializer</em> and a <em>StringWriter</em> to get the string. Which is all good. I intend to put the method to return the string into a generic utility method so I don't need to worry about type etc.</p>
<p>The this that concerns me is this: If I do not decorate the class(es) with the required attributes an error is not thrown until run time.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any way to enforce attribute decoration? Can this be done with FxCop?</strong> (I have not used FxCop yet)</p>

"19481","<p>Another discussion (we've been having a lot of them these days!) in our work is whether data binding is a bad idea or not.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it is a Bad Thing™.</p>

<p>My reasons are thrice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It circumvents my well architectured MVP framework - with databinding, the view communicates bi-directionally with a model.  Ewww.</p></li>
<li><p>It promotes hooking up view controls to datafields at design time.  In my experience, this leads to vital code (binding column A to Field X) being obscure and hidden away in some designer file.  IMO this code should be explicit and in-your-face, so that it is easy to modify and see what is going on, without having to use a clunky designer interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Relating to Point #1 this direct binding makes it harder to isolate each component (view, model, controller/presenter) and unit-test.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The pros are that it is easy to set up, and you can take advantage of some nice features (validation etc) which come with the plumbing already done for you.  </p>

<p>But for me, databinding becomes much more of a hindrance when dealing with a large data-centric application.</p>

"19493","<p>I'm trying to redirect all requests to my domain to another domain using mod_rewrite in an Apache 2.2 VirtualHost declaration.  There is one exception to this -- I'd like all requests  to the <code>/audio</code> path <em>not</em> to be redirected.</p>

<p>I've written a RewriteCond and RewriteRule to do this but it's not quite right and I can't figure out why.  The regular expression contains a negative lookahead for the string ""/audio"", but for some reason this isn't matching.  Here's the definition:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net(?!/audio) [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.newdomain.net [L,R=301]
</code></pre>

<p>If I change the RewriteCond to:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(.*\.)?mydomain\.net/(?!audio) [NC]
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. put the forward slash outside of the negative lookahead part) then it works, but the downside of this is that requests to mydomain.net without a trailing slash will not be redirected.</p>

<p>Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>(Note: the angle brackets around the domain in the RewriteRule bit above are being added by StackOverflow.com -- they are not there in the actual code!)</p>

<p>You get the idea.
All callers of MyFunction <em>should</em> check the returned Status:</p>

<pre><code>Status myStatus = MyFunction();
if ( ! myStatus.IsOK() )

<p>In this case there are no unmanaged resources to free.
Additionally, it is not determined <em>when</em> the GC will dispose the object.

<p>I would like to import the application to Maven and Subversion. After some research I found that two practical approaches exists for this.</p>

<p>One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.</p>

<p>The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.</p>

<p>Which way would you choose in the long term and why?</p>

"20021","<p>I'm currently looking at the Python framework Django for future db-based web apps as well as for a port of some apps currently written in PHP. One of the nastier issues during my last years was keeping track of database schema changes and deploying these changes to productive systems. I haven't dared asking for being able to undo them too, but of course for testing and debugging that would be a great feature. From other questions here (such as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1607/mechanisms-for-tracking-db-schema-changes"">this one</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/173/how-do-i-version-my-ms-sql-database-in-svn"">this one</a>), I can see that I'm not alone and that this is not a trivial problem. Also, I found many inspirations in the answers there.</p>

<p>Now, as Django seems to be very powerful, does it have any tools to help with the above? Maybe it's even in their docs and I missed it?</p>

"20034","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Darkstar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Project Darkstar</a> was the topic of the monthly <a href=""http://www.javasig.com/meeting/home.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaSIG</a> meeting down at the Google offices in NYC last night.  For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the ""hard stuff.""  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>

<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>

<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>

<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>

<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>

"20047","<p>We're seeing some pernicious, but rare, deadlock conditions in the Stack Overflow SQL Server 2005 database.</p>

<p>I attached the profiler, set up a trace profile using <a href=""http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-track-down-deadlocks-using-sql-server-2005-profiler/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this excellent article on troubleshooting deadlocks</a>, and captured a bunch of examples. The weird thing is that <strong>the deadlocking write is <em>always</em> the same</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE [dbo].[Posts]
SET [AnswerCount] = @p1, [LastActivityDate] = @p2, [LastActivityUserId] = @p3
WHERE [Id] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>The other deadlocking statement varies, but it's usually some kind of trivial, simple <strong>read</strong> of the posts table. This one always gets killed in the deadlock. Here's an example</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
[t0].[Id], [t0].[PostTypeId], [t0].[Score], [t0].[Views], [t0].[AnswerCount], 
[t0].[AcceptedAnswerId], [t0].[IsLocked], [t0].[IsLockedEdit], [t0].[ParentId], 
[t0].[CurrentRevisionId], [t0].[FirstRevisionId], [t0].[LockedReason],
[t0].[LastActivityDate], [t0].[LastActivityUserId]
FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[ParentId] = @p0
</code></pre>

<p>To be perfectly clear, we are not seeing write / write deadlocks, but read / write.</p>

<p>We have a mixture of LINQ and parameterized SQL queries at the moment. We have added <code>with (nolock)</code> to all the SQL queries. This may have helped some. We also had a single (very) poorly-written badge query that I fixed yesterday, which was taking upwards of 20 seconds to run every time, and was running every minute on top of that. I was hoping this was the source of some of the locking problems!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I got another deadlock error about 2 hours ago. Same exact symptoms, same exact culprit write.</p>

<p>The truly strange thing is that the locking write SQL statement you see above is part of a very specific code path. It's <em>only</em> executed when a new answer is added to a question -- it updates the parent question with the new answer count and last date/user. This is, obviously, not that common relative to the massive number of reads we are doing! As far as I can tell, we're not doing huge numbers of writes anywhere in the app.</p>

<p>I realize that NOLOCK is sort of a giant hammer, but most of the queries we run here don't need to be that accurate. Will you care if your user profile is a few seconds out of date?</p>

<p>Using NOLOCK with Linq is a bit more difficult as <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/GettingLINQToSQLAndLINQToEntitiesToUseNOLOCK.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scott Hanselman discusses here</a>.</p>

<p>We are flirting with the idea of using</p>

<pre><code>SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
</code></pre>

<p>on the base database context so that all our LINQ queries have this set. Without that, we'd have to wrap every LINQ call we make (well, the simple reading ones, which is the vast majority of them) in a 3-4 line transaction code block, which is ugly.</p>

<p>I guess I'm a little frustrated that trivial reads in SQL 2005 can deadlock on writes. I could see write/write deadlocks being a huge issue, but <em>reads?</em> We're not running a banking site here, we don't need perfect accuracy every time.</p>

<p>Ideas? Thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you instantiating a new LINQ to SQL DataContext object for every operation or are you perhaps sharing the same static context for all your calls?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy, we are sharing one static datacontext in the base Controller for the most part:</p>

<pre><code>private DBContext _db;
/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Gets the DataContext to be used by a Request's controllers.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public DBContext DB
{
    get
    {

            //_db.ExecuteCommand(""SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED"");
        }
        return _db;
    }
}

<p>The problem I have is that I have a collection, which is of a abstract base class type, which is populated by the concrete derived types.</p>

<p>I thought it would be fine to just add the XML attributes to all of the classes involved and everything would be peachy. Sadly, thats not the case!</p>

<p>So I have done some digging on Google and I now understand <em>why</em> it's not working. In that <strong>the <code>XmlSerializer</code> is in fact doing some clever reflection in order to serialize objects to/from XML, and since its based on the abstract type, it cannot figure out what the hell it's talking to</strong>.

"20262","<p>I've joined a team that works on a product. This product has been around for ~5 years or so, and uses ASP.NET WebForms. Its original architecture has faded over time, and things have become relatively disorganized throughout the solution. It's by no means terrible, but definitely can use some work; you all know what I mean.</p>

<p>I've been performing some refactorings since coming on to the project team about 6 months ago. Some of those refactorings are simple, Extract Method, Pull Method Up, etc. Some of the refactorings are more structural. The latter changes make me nervous as there isn't a comprehensive suite of unit tests to accompany every component. </p>

<p>The whole team is on board for the need to make structural changes through refactoring, but our Project Manager has expressed some concerns that we don't have adequate tests to make refactorings with the confidence that we aren't introducing regression bugs into the system. He would like us to write more tests first (against the existing architecture), then perform the refactorings. My argument is that the system's class structure is too tightly coupled to write adequate tests, and that using a more Test Driven approach while we perform our refactorings may be better. What I mean by this is not writing tests against the existing components, but writing tests for specific functional requirements, then refactoring existing code to meet those requirements. This will allow us to write tests that will probably have more longevity in the system, rather than writing a bunch of 'throw away' tests.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience as to what the best course of action is? I have my own thoughts, but would like to hear some input from the community.</p>

<p>I'm creating a procedure that is going to take a list of keywords to be searched for in a column that contains text. If I was sitting at the console, I'd execute it as such:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
 WHERE Description LIKE '%warrior%' 
       OR
       Description LIKE '%fiend%' 
       OR 
       Description LIKE '%damage%'
</code></pre>

<p>But a trick I picked up a little while go to do ""strongly typed"" list parsing in a stored procedure is to parse the list into a table variable/temporary table, converting it to the proper type and then doing an INNER JOIN against that table in my final result set. This works great when sending say a list of integer IDs to the procedure. I wind up having a final query that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblExclusiveCard ON dbo.Card.Id = @tblExclusiveCard.CardId
</code></pre>

<p>I want to use this trick with a list of strings. But since I'm looking for a particular keyword, I am going to use the LIKE clause. So ideally I'm thinking I'd have my final query look like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Name, Description
  FROM dbo.Card
       INNER JOIN @tblKeyword ON dbo.Card.Description LIKE '%' + @tblKeyword.Value + '%'
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible/recommended?</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do something like this?</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason I'm putting wildcards on both ends of the clause is because there are ""archfiend"", ""beast-warrior"", ""direct-damage"" and ""battle-damage"" terms that are used in the card texts.</p>

<p>I'm getting the impression that depending on the performance, I can either use the query I specified or use a full-text keyword search to accomplish the same task? </p>

<p>However, we've found the pain point with ClickOnce is in <em>creating</em> the deployments. We have the standard dev/test/production environments and need to be able to create deployments for each of these that install and update separate from one another. Also, we want control over what assemblies get deployed. Just because an assembly was compiled doesn't mean we want it deployed.</p>

<p>The obvious first choice for creating deployments is Visual Studio. However, VS really doesn't address the issues stated. The next in line is the SDK tool, Mage. Mage works OK but creating deployments is rather tedious and we don't want every developer having our code signing certificate and password.</p>

<p>What we ended up doing was rolling our own deployment app that uses the command line version of Mage to create the ClickOnce manifest files.</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul>
<li>The solution needs to handle XML
data sources that use character
encodings other than UTF-8, e.g. by
specifying the character encoding at
the XML document declaration. Not
mangling the character encoding of
the source while stripping invalid
hexadecimal characters has been a
major sticking point.</li>
<li>The removal of invalid hexadecimal characters should only remove hexadecimal encoded values, as you can often find href values in data that happens to contains a string that would be a string match for a hexadecimal character.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Background:</em></p>

<p>I need to consume an XML-based data source that conforms to a specific format (think Atom or RSS feeds), but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the XML specification.</p>

<p>In .NET if you have a Stream that represents the XML data source, and then attempt to parse it using an XmlReader and/or XPathDocument, an exception is raised due to the inclusion of invalid hexadecimal characters in the XML data. My current attempt to resolve this issue is to parse the Stream as a string and use a regular expression to remove and/or replace the invalid hexadecimal characters, but I am looking for a more performant solution.</p>

I want to be able to arbitrarily order these images, storing that ordering in the database so when I display the objects, they will be in the right order.</p>

<p>For example, let's say I'm writing a book, and each chapter is an object.  I write my book, and put the chapters in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduction, Accessibility, Form vs. Function, Errors, Consistency, Conclusion, Index</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes to the editor, and comes back with the following suggested order:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduction, Form, Function, Accessibility, Consistency, Errors, Conclusion, Index</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I store this ordering in the database in a robust, efficient way?</p>

<p>I've had the following ideas, but I'm not thrilled with any of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Array.  Each row has an ordering ID, when order is changed (via a removal followed by an insertion), the order IDs are updated.  This makes retrieval easy, since it's just <code>ORDER BY</code>, but it seems easy to break.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>// REMOVAL</code><br>
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=NULL WHERE orderingID=removedID</code><br>
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID-1 WHERE orderingID &gt; removedID</code><br>
  <code>// INSERTION</code><br>
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderingID=orderingID+1 WHERE orderingID &gt; insertionID</code><br>
  <code>UPDATE ... SET orderID=insertionID WHERE ID=addedID</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Linked list. Each row has a column for the id of the next row in the ordering.  Traversal seems costly here, though there may by some way to use <code>ORDER BY</code> that I'm not thinking of.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaced array.  Set the orderingID (as used in #1) to be large, so the first object is 100, the second is 200, etc.  Then when an insertion happens, you just place it at <code>(objectBefore + objectAfter)/2</code>.  Of course, this would need to be rebalanced occasionally, so you don't have things too close together (even with floats, you'd eventually run into rounding errors).</p></li>

"21583","<p>This past summer I was developing a basic ASP.NET/SQL Server CRUD app, and unit testing was one of the requirements.  I ran into some trouble when I tried to test against the database.  To my understanding, unit tests should be:</p>

<ul>
<li>stateless</li>
<li>independent from each other</li>
<li>repeatable with the same results i.e. no persisting changes</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements seem to be at odds with each other when developing for a database.  For example, I can't test Insert() without making sure the rows to be inserted aren't there yet, thus I need to call the Delete() first.  But, what if they aren't already there?  Then I would need to call the Exists() function first.</p>

<p>My eventual solution involved very large setup functions (yuck!) and an empty test case which would run first and indicate that the setup ran without problems.  This is sacrificing on the independence of the tests while maintaining their statelessness.</p>

<p>Another solution I found is to wrap the function calls in a transaction which can be easily rolled back, like <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/10/05/238201.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Roy Osherove's XtUnit</a>.  This work, but it involves another library, another dependency, and it seems a little too heavy of a solution for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Cheekysoft, I like the concept of a ServiceLayerException. I already have a global exception module for the exceptions that I don't anticipate. Do you find making all these custom exceptions tedious? I was thinking that catching base Exception class was a bit smelly but wasn't exactly sure how progress from there.</p>

<p>tgmdbm, I like the clever use of the lambda expression there!</p>

<p>Thanks Cheekysoft for the follow-up. So I'm guessing that would be the strategy if you don't mind the user being displayed a separate page (I'm primarily a web developer) if the Exception is not handled.</p>

<p>However, if I want to return the error message in the same view where the user submitted the data that caused the error, I would then have to catch the Exception in the Presenter?</p>

<li>GIN indexes take about three times longer to build than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes are about ten times slower to update than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes are two-to-three times larger than GiST</li>
</ul>

<p>However I would be particularly interested to know if there is a performance impact when the memory to index size ration starts getting small (ie. the index size becomes much bigger than the available memory)? I've been told on the #postgresql IRC channel that GIN needs to keep all the index in memory, otherwise it won't be effective, because, unlike B-Tree, it doesn't know which part to read in from disk for a particular query? The question would be: is this true (because I've also been told the opposite of this)? Does GiST have the same restrictions? Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>

I'm not looking for a full-blown ORM, but it might be the way to go and others who view this question might be looking for that.  </p>

<p>I have a C++ DLL for 3D rendering that is what we sell to customers. For .NET users we will have a CLR wrapper around it. The C++ DLL can be built in both 32 and 64bit versions, but I think this means we need to have two CLR wrappers since the CLR binds to a specific DLL? </p>

<p>Say now our customer has a .NET app that can be either 32 or 64bit, and that it being a pure .NET app it leaves the CLR to work it out from a single set of assemblies. The question is how can the app code dynamically choose between our 32 and 64bit CLR/DLL combinations at run-time?</p>

<p>I need to use push-technology with WCF through client firewalls. This must be a common problem, and I know for a fact it works in theory (see links below), but I have failed to get it working, and I haven't been able to find a code sample that demonstrates it.</p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>Clients connects to server through tcp port 80 (netTcpBinding).</li>
<li>Server pushes back information at irregular intervals (1 min to several hours).</li>
<li>Users should not have to configure their firewalls, server pushes must pass through firewalls that have all inbound ports closed. TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>
<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>
<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding. Based on this information:</p>

<p><strong>A Simple Example:</strong></p>

<p>Certain pages on my site are only accessible to logged in users. I have two options for implementation (there are others but let's limit it to these two)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Create an authenticate.php file and include it on every page. It holds the logic for authentication.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Create a user object, which has an authenticate function, reference the object for authentication on every page.</em> </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I'd like to see some way weigh the benefits of one over the other. 
My current (and weak reasons) follow:</p>

<p>Includes - Sometimes a function is just easier/shorter/faster to call
Objects - Grouping of functionality and properties leads for longer term maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Includes</strong> - Less code to write (no constructor, no class syntax) call me lazy but this is true.</p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong> - Force formality and a single approach to functions and creation. </p>

<p><strong>Includes</strong> - Easier for a novice to deal with
Objects - Harder for novices, but frowned upon by professionals.</p>

"22570","<p>Here is the issue I am having: I have a large query that needs to compare datetimes in the where clause to see if two dates are on the same day.  My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>

I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.</p>

<p>And everything seems to be working according to plan, but when trying to make the app show unread messages in my message view, I run into problems.</p>

<pre><code>bob = User.find_by_name(""bob"")

bob.readings                      # =&gt; []

<p>So it seems that if I wanted to list the number of unread messages sitting in a mailbox (for example Inbox (39) ), I should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Post.find_unread_by(current-user).count %&gt;

<p>But to no avail.  I always seem to get stuck on the simple view issues after everything's set.

"22988","<p>I have several ""ASP:TextBox"" controls on a form (about 20).<br>
When the form loads, the text boxes are populated from a database.<br>
The user can change the populated values, and when they submit the form, I take the values posted to the server and conditionally save them (determined by some business logic).<br>
All but 1 of the text boxes work as intended.</p>

<p>The odd box out, upon postback, does not contain the updated value that the user typed into the box.<br>
When debugging the application, it is clear that <code>myTextBox.Text</code> reflects the old, pre-populated value, not the new, user-supplied value.<br>
Every other box properly shows their respective user-supplied values.</p>

<p>I did find a workaround.<br>
My solution was to basically extract the text box's value out of the <code>Request.Form</code> object:   <code>Request.Form[myTextBox.UniqueID]</code>, which does contain the user-supplied value.</p>

<p>What could be going on, here?<br>
As I mentioned, the other text boxes receive the user-supplied values just fine, and this particular problematic text box doesn't have any logic associated to it -- it just takes the value and saves it.<br>
The main difference between this text box and the others is that this is a multi-line box (for inputting notes), which I believe is rendered as an HTML ""textarea"" tag instead of an ""input"" tag in ASP.NET.</p>

"23197","<p>I have a library that reads/writes to a USB-device using CreateFile() API. The device happens to implement the HID-device profile, such that it's compatible with Microsoft's HID class driver.</p>

<p>Some other application installed on the system is opening the device in read/write mode with no share mode. Which prevents my library (and anything that consumes it) from working with the device. I suppose that's the rub with being an HID-compatible device -- other driver software (mice, controllers, PHIDGETS, etc) can be uncooperative. </p>

<p>Anyway, the device file path is of the form: </p>

    FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

<p>I'm thinking the most efficient would be the following:</p>

<li>If not, find next lowest</li>

<p>I'm basing this assumption on it being easier to calculate the small prime factors. Is this about right? What other approaches should I look into?</p>

<p>Edit: I've now realised that my approach is futile if there are more than 2 prime factors in play, since step 2 fails when the result is a product of two other primes, therefore a recursive algorithm is needed.</p>

<p>Edit again: And now I've realised that this does still work, because the last found prime number has to be the highest one, therefore any further testing of the non-prime result from step 2 would result in a smaller prime.</p>

Work that includes maintaining a very large and soul destroying website that consists of a hodge podge of VBScript, javascript, Dreamweaver generated cruft and a collection of add-ons that various conmen have convinced them to buy over the years. </p>

<p>A few days ago I got a call ""The website is locking up for people using Safari!"" Okay, step one download Safari(v3.1.2), step two surf to the site. Everything appears to work fine.</p>

<p>Long story short I finally isolated the problem and it relates to Safari's back button. The website uses a fancy-pants javascript menu that works in every browser I've tried including Safari, the first time around. But in Safari if you follow a link off the page and then hit the back button the menu no longer works.</p>

<p>I made a pared down webpage to illustrate the principle.</p>

<li>Anything else?</li>

Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>

"24270","<p>As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p>

<p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p>

<p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p>

<p>I'm developing a tool in <strong>PHP</strong> that could attain quite a lot of users, if it works out right. However while I'm fully capable of developing the program I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to making something that can deal with huge traffic. So here's a few questions on it (feel free to turn this question into a resource thread as well).</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>At the moment I plan to use the MySQLi features in PHP5. However how should I setup the databases in relation to users and content? Do I actually <em>need</em> multiple databases? At the moment everything's jumbled into one database - although I've been considering spreading user data to one, actual content to another and finally core site content (template masters etc.) to another. My reasoning behind this is that sending queries to different databases will ease up the load on them as one database = 3 load sources. Also would this still be effective if they were all on the same server?</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>I have a template system that is used to build the pages and swap out variables. Master templates are stored in the database and each time a template is called it's cached copy (a html document) is called. At the moment I have two types of variable in these templates - a static var and a dynamic var. Static vars are usually things like page names, the name of the site - things that don't change often; dynamic vars are things that change on each page load.</p>

<p>My question on this:</p>

<p>Say I have comments on different articles. Which is a better solution: store the simple comment template and render comments (from a DB call) each time the page is loaded or store a cached copy of the comments page as a html page - each time a comment is added/edited/deleted the page is recached.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>Does anyone have any tips/pointers for running a high load site on PHP. I'm pretty sure it's a workable language to use - Facebook and Yahoo! give it great precedence - but are there any experiences I should watch out for?</p>

I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like <code>Page.Response.BufferOutput = False</code>. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference?

<li>Some tests seem to take forever to implement.. Such as when working with string output, is there a ""better"" way to go about this sort of thing?

<li>I don't have a testing framework to use (work wont pay for one) so I can ""practice"" more. Are there any good ones that are free for commercial use? (at the moment I am using good 'ol <em>Debug.Assert</em> :)</li>
<li>Probably the biggest.. Sometimes I don't know what to expect <em>NOT</em> to happen.. I mean, you get your green light but I am always concerned that I may be missing a test..

<p>Based on Marius and Andy's answers I'm using the following solution:</p>

<p>Works perfectly - Only adjustment I had to make from Marius solution was to use 256, as (255 - (percent - 50) * 5.12 yield -1 when 100%, resulting in Yellow for some reason in Silverlight (-1, 255, 0) -> Yellow ...</p>

<p>From reading the Javadoc about <code>readLine()</code> it says: </p>

<p>Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed (<code>\n</code>), a carriage return (<code>\r</code>), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. </p>

<p><strong>Returns</strong>:
A <code>String</code> containing the contents of the line, not including any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the stream has been reached </p>

<p><strong>Throws</strong>:

<p>From my understanding of this, <code>readLine</code> should return null the first time no input is entered other than a line termination, like <code>\r</code>.

"25132","<p>I did a lot of PHP programming in the last years and one thing that keeps annoying me is the weak support for Unicode and multibyte strings (to be sure, natively there is none). For example, &quot;htmlentities&quot; seems to be a much used function in the PHP world and I found it to be absolutely annoying when you've put an effort into keeping every string localizable, only store UTF-8 in your database, only deliver UTF-8 webpages etc. Suddenly, somewhere between your database and the browser there's this hopelessly naive function pretending every byte is a character and messes everything up.</p>
<p>I would just <i>love</i> to just dump this kind of functions, they seem totally superfluous. <b>Is it still necessary these days to write '&amp;auml;' instead of 'ä'?</b> At least my Firefox seems perfectly happy to display even the strangest Asian glyphs as long as they're served in a proper encoding.</p>

"26148","<p>At my job, I have a clutch of six Windows services that I am responsible for, written in C# 2003. Each of these services contain a timer that fires every minute or so, where the majority of their work happens.</p>

<p>My problem is that, as these services run, they start to consume more and more CPU time through each iteration of the loop, even if there is no meaningful work for them to do (ie, they're just idling, looking through the database for something to do). When they start up, each service uses an average of (about) 2-3% of 4 CPUs, which is fine. After 24 hours, each service will be consuming an entire processor for the duration of its loop's run.</p>

<p>Can anyone help? I'm at a loss as to what could be causing this. Our current solution is to restart the services once a day (they shut themselves down, then a script sees that they're offline and restarts them at about 3AM). But this is not a long term solution; my concern is that as the services get busier, restarting them once a day may not be sufficient... but as there's a significant startup penalty (they all use NHibernate for data access), as they get busier, exactly what we <em>don't</em> want to be doing is restarting them more frequently.</p>

<hr>

<p>@akmad: True, it is very difficult.</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, a service run in isolation will show the same symptom over time.</li>
<li>No, it doesn't. We've looked at that. This can happen at 10AM or 6PM or in the middle of the night. There's no consistency.</li>
<li>We do; and they are. The services are doing exactly what they should be, and nothing else.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, that requires foreknowledge of exactly when the services are going to be maxing out CPUs, which happens on an unpredictable schedule, and never very quickly... which makes things doubly difficult, because my boss will run and restart them when they start having problems without thinking of debug issues.</li>
<li>No, they're using a fairly consistent amount of RAM (approx. 60-80MB each, out of 4GB on the machine).</li>
</ol>

<p>Good suggestions, but rest assured, we have tried all of the usual troubleshooting. What I'm hoping is that this is a .NET issue that someone might know about, that we can work on solving. My boss' solution (which I emphatically don't want to implement) is to put a field in the database which holds multiple times for the services to restart during the day, so that he can make the problem go away and not think about it. I'm desperately seeking the cause of the real problem so that I can fix it, because that solution will become a disaster in about six months.</p>

<hr>

<p>@Yaakov Ellis: They each have a different function. One reads records out of an Oracle database somewhere offsite; another one processes those records and transfers files belonging to those records over to our system; a third checks those files to make sure they're what we expect them to be; another is a maintenance service that constantly checks things like disk space (that we have enough) and polls other servers to make sure they're alive; one is running only to make sure all of these other ones are running and doing their jobs, monitors and reports errors, and restarts anything that's failed to keep the whole system going 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>So, if you're asking what I think you're asking, no, there isn't one common thing that all these services do (other than database access via NHibernate) that I can point to as a potential problem. Unfortunately, if that turns out to be the actual issue (which wouldn't surprise me greatly), the whole thing might be screwed -- and I'll end up rewriting all of them in simple SQL. I'm hoping it's a garbage collector problem or something easier to deal with than NHibernate.</p>

<hr>

<p>@Joshdan: No secret. As I said, we've tried all the usual troubleshooting. Profiling was unhelpful: the profiler we use was unable to point to any code that was actually executing when the CPU usage was high. These services were torn apart about a month ago looking for this problem. Every section of code was analyzed to attempt to figure out if our code was the issue; I'm not here asking because I haven't done my homework. Were this a simple case of the services doing more work than anticipated, that's something that would have been caught. </p>

<p>The problem here is that, most of the time, the services are not doing anything at all, yet still manage to consume 25% or more of four CPU cores: they're finding no work to do, and exiting their loop and waiting for the next iteration. This should, quite literally, take almost no CPU time at all.</p>

<p>Here's a example of behaviour we're seeing, on a service with no work to do for two days (in an unchanging environment). This was captured last week:</p>

<p>Day 1, 8AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 3%<br>
Day 1, 6PM: Avg. CPU usage approx 8%<br>
Day 2, 7AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 20%<br>
Day 2, 11AM: Avg. CPU usage approx 30%  </p>

<p>Having looked at all of the possible mundane reasons for this, I've asked this question here because I figured (rightly, as it turns out) that I'd get more innovative answers (like Ubiguchi's), or pointers to things I <em>hadn't</em> thought of (like Ian's suggestion).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>So does the CPU spike happen
  immediately preceding the timer
  callback, within the timer callback,
  or immediately following the timer
  callback?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You misunderstand. This is not a spike. If it were, there would be no problem; I can deal with spikes. But it's not... the CPU usage is going up generally. Even when the service is doing nothing, waiting for the next timer hit. When the service starts up, things are nice and calm, and the graph looks like what you'd expect... generally, 0% usage, with spikes to 10% as NHibernate hits the database or the service does some trivial amount of work. But this increases to an across-the-board 25% (more if I let it go too far) usage at all times while the process is running.</p>

<p>That made Ian's suggestion the logical silver bullet (NHibernate does <em>a lot</em> of stuff when you're not looking). Alas, I've implemented his solution, but it hasn't had an effect (I have no proof of this, but I actually think it's made things worse... average usage is <em>seeming</em> to go up much faster now). Note that stripping out the NHibernate ""sections"" (as you recommend) is not feasible, since that would strip out about 90% of the code in the service, which would let me rule out the timer as a problem (which I absolutely intend to try), but can't help me rule out NHibernate as the issue, because if NHibernate is causing this, then the dodgy fix that's implemented (see below) is just going to have to become The Way The System Works; we are so dependent on NHibernate for this project that the PM simply won't accept that it's causing an unresolvable structural problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just noted a sense of desperation in
  the question -- that your problems
  would continue barring a small miracle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't mean for it to come off that way. At the moment, the services are being restarted daily (with an option to input any number of hours of the day for them to shutdown and restart), which patches the problem but cannot be a long-term solution once they go onto the production machine and start to become busy. The problems will not continue, whether I fix them or the PM maintains this constraint on them. Obviously, I would prefer to implement a real fix, but since the initial testing revealed no reason for this, and the services have already been extensively reviewed, the PM would rather just have them restart multiple times than spend any more time trying to fix them. That's entirely out of my control and makes the miracle you were talking about more important than it would otherwise be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is extremely intriguing (insofar
  as you trust your profiler).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't. But then, these are Windows services written in .NET 1.1 running on a Windows 2000 machine, deployed by a dodgy Nant script, using an old version of NHibernate for database access. There's little on that machine I would actually say I trust.</p>

<p>Is this kind of discussion happening anywhere?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Georgia</p>

<p>My question isn't about design patterns or pattern languages; it's about trying to see if more of Christopher Alexander's work can be applied to software (which it probably can, since it has even less physical constraints than architecture and building).</p>

<p>Design patterns and pattern languages seem to have embraced the structure of Alexander's design patterns, but not many capture the essence. The essence being something beyond solving a problem in a particular context.</p>

<p>It's difficult to explain without using some of Alexander's later works as a reference point.</p>

<p>Edit: No, I take that back.</p>

<p>For example, there's an architectural design pattern that is called Alcoves. The pattern has a context that isn't just rooted in the circumstances of the situation but also rooted in fundamentals about the purpose of buildings: that they are structures to be lived in and must promote living in them. In the case of the Alcove pattern, the context is that you want an area that allows for multiple people to be in the same area doing different things, because it is important for family members to be physically together as well as to be able to do things that tend to distract other family members.</p>

<p>Most software design patterns describe a problem in a context, but they make no deeper statement about why the problem is important, or why the problem is something that is fundamental to software. It makes it very easy to apply design patterns inappropriately or blithely, which is the exact opposite of the intent of design patterns to began with.</p>

"26383","<p>I know two approaches to Exception handling, lets have a look at them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Contract approach.</p>
<p>When a method does not do what it says it will do in the method header, it will throw an exception. Thus the method &quot;promises&quot; that it will do the operation, and if it fails for some reason, it will throw an exception.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exceptional approach.</p>
<p>Only throw exceptions when something truly weird happens. You should not use exceptions when you can resolve the situation with normal control flow (If statements). You don't use Exceptions for control flow, as you might in the contract approach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets use both approaches in different cases:</p>
<p>We have a Customer class that has a method called OrderProduct.</p>
<p>contract approach:</p>
<pre><code>class Customer
{
     public void OrderProduct(Product product)
     {
           if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0)
                  throw new NoCreditException(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;);
           // do stuff 
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>exceptional approach:</p>
<pre><code>class Customer
{
     public bool OrderProduct(Product product)
     {
          if((m_credit - product.Price) &lt; 0)
                   return false;
          // do stuff
          return true;
     }
}

if !(customer.OrderProduct(product))
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Not enough credit!&quot;);
else
   // go on with your life
</code></pre>
<p>Here I prefer the exceptional approach, as it is not truly Exceptional that a customer has no money assuming he did not win the lottery.</p>
<p>But here is a situation I err on the contract style.</p>
<p>Exceptional:</p>
<pre><code>class CarController
{
     // returns null if car creation failed.
     public Car CreateCar(string model)
     {
         // something went wrong, wrong model
         return null;
     }
 }
</code></pre>
<p>When I call a method called CreateCar, I damn wel expect a Car instance instead of some lousy null pointer, which can ravage my running code a dozen lines later. Thus I prefer contract to this one:</p>
<pre><code>class CarController
{
     
     public Car CreateCar(string model)
     {
         // something went wrong, wrong model
         throw new CarModelNotKnownException(&quot;Model unkown&quot;);

         return new Car();
     }
 }
</code></pre>

"27294","<p>I'm working on an internal project for my company, and part of the project is to be able to parse various ""Tasks"" from an XML file into a collection of tasks to be ran later.</p>

<p>Because each type of Task has a multitude of different associated fields, I decided it would be best to represent each type of Task with a seperate class.</p>

<p>To do this, I constructed an abstract base class:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Task
{
    public enum TaskType
    {
        // Types of Tasks
    }   

    public abstract TaskType Type
    {
        get;
    }   

    public abstract LoadFromXml(XmlElement task);
    public abstract XmlElement CreateXml(XmlDocument currentDoc);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each task inherited from this base class, and included the code necessary to create itself from the passed in XmlElement, as well as serialize itself back out to an XmlElement.</p>

<p>A basic example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MergeTask : Task
{

    public override TaskType Type
    {
        get { return TaskType.Merge; }
    }   

    // Lots of Properties / Methods for this Task

    public MergeTask (XmlElement elem)
    {
        this.LoadFromXml(elem);
    }

    public override LoadFromXml(XmlElement task)
    {
        // Populates this Task from the Xml.
    }

    public override XmlElement CreateXml(XmlDocument currentDoc)
    {
        // Serializes this class back to xml.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parser would then use code similar to this to create a task collection:</p>

<pre><code>XmlNode taskNode = parent.SelectNode(""tasks"");

TaskFactory tf = new TaskFactory();

foreach (XmlNode task in taskNode.ChildNodes)
{
    // Since XmlComments etc will show up
    if (task is XmlElement)
    {
        tasks.Add(tf.CreateTask(task as XmlElement));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All of this works wonderfully, and allows me to pass tasks around using the base class, while retaining the structure of having individual classes for each task.</p>

<p>However, I am not happy with my code for TaskFactory.CreateTask. This method accepts an XmlElement, and then returns an instance of the appropriate Task class:</p>

<pre><code>public Task CreateTask(XmlElement elem)
{
    if (elem != null)
    {
        switch(elem.Name)
        {
            case ""merge"":
                return new MergeTask(elem);
            default:
                throw new ArgumentException(""Invalid Task"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because I have to parse the XMLElement, I'm using a huge (10-15 cases in the real code) switch to pick which child class to instantiate. I'm hoping there is some sort of polymorphic trick I can do here to clean up this method.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wide columns of text are hard to read.</li>

<p>I'm not very experienced with internationalization using PHP, it must be said, and a deal of searching didn't really provide the answers I was looking for.</p>

<p>I'm in need of working out a reliable way to convert only 'relevant' text to Unicode to send in an SMS message, using PHP (just temporarily, whilst service is rewritten using C#) - obviously, messages sent at the moment are sent as plain text.</p>

<p>I could conceivably convert everything to the Unicode charset (as opposed to using the standard GSM charset), but that would mean that <em>all</em> messages would be limited to 70 characters (instead of 160).</p>

<p>So, I guess my real question is: <em>what is the most reliable way to detect the requirement for a message to be Unicode-encoded, so I only have to do it when it's</em> <strong><em>absolutely necessary</em></strong> <em>(e.g. for non-Latin-language characters)?</em></p>

<h2>Added Info:</h2>

<p>Okay, so I've spent the morning working on this, and I'm still no further on than when I started (certainly due to my complete lack of competency when it comes to charset conversion).  So here's the revised scenario:</p>

<p>I have text SMS messages coming from an external source, this external source provides the responses to me in plain text + Unicode slash-escaped characters.  E.g. the 'displayed' text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's test öäü éàè אין תמיכה בעברית</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's test \u00f6\u00e4\u00fc \u00e9\u00e0\u00e8 \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I can send on to my SMS provider in plaintext, GSM 03.38 or Unicode.  Obviously, sending the above as plaintext results in a lot of missing characters (they're replaced by spaces by my provider) - I need to adopt relating to what content there is.  What I want to <em>do</em> with this is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If all text is within the <a href=""http://www.dreamfabric.com/sms/default_alphabet.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GSM 03.38 codepage</a>, send it as-is.  (All but the Hebrew characters above fit into this category, but need to be converted.)</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, convert it to Unicode, and send it over multiple messages (as the Unicode limit is 70 chars not 160 for an SMS).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I said above, I'm stumped on doing this in PHP (C# wasn't much of an issue due to some simple conversion functions built-in), but it's quite probable I'm just missing the obvious, here.  I couldn't find any pre-made conversion classes for 7-bit encoding in PHP, either - and my attempts to convert the string myself and send it on seemed futile.</p>

<p><strong>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>

"27607","<p>Let's say I have a list of server names stored in a vector, and I would like to contact them one at a time until one has successfully responded. I was thinking about using STL's find_if algorithm in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>find_if(serverNames.begin(), serverNames.end(), ContactServer());
</code></pre>

<p>Where ContactServer is a predicate function object.<br>
On one hand, there's a problem since the predicate will not always return the same result for the same server name (because of server downtime, network problems, etc...). However, the same result will be returned regardless of which copy of the predicate is used (<em>i.e.</em> the predicate has no real state), so the original problem with state-keeping predicates is not relevant in this case.</p>

<li>how to set it up in the calling application</li>

      &lt;/listeners&gt;
    &lt;/trace&gt;

<p>This will add a <code>TextWriterTraceListener</code> that will catch everything you send to with <code>Trace.WriteLine</code>, etc.</p>
<p>@DanEsparza pointed out that you should use <code>Trace.TraceInformation</code>, <code>Trace.TraceWarning</code> and <code>Trace.TraceError</code> instead of <code>Trace.WriteLine</code>, as they allow you to format messages the same way as <code>string.Format</code>.</p>

<p>We have OSGi bundles which depend on other OSGi bundles. I'd really hate to hardcode build order in a custom ANT build. We've done this is the past and it's pretty horrible.

<p>The generated build scripts are only usable via Eclipse. They require manually running pieces of Eclipse.

I'd like to setup my own build.xml to build each, BUT there are dependencies and build order issues. These issues are driven by the Manifest files (which describe OSGi imports). For example, PluginC depends on PluginB which depends on PluginA. They must be built in the correct order.

<p><em>Edit:</em> Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if HttpOnly is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?</p>

<p><em>Edit 2:</em> Question 2. If the purpose of HttpOnly is to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, and you can still retrieve the cookies via JavaScript through the XmlHttpRequest Object, <strong>what is the point of HttpOnly</strong>?</p>

<p><em>Edit 3:</em> Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the browser receives such a cookie, it is supposed to use it as usual in the following HTTP exchanges, but not to make it visible to client-side scripts.[32] The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag is not part of any standard, and is not implemented in all browsers. Note that there is currently no prevention of reading or writing the session cookie via a XMLHTTPRequest. [33].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that <code>document.cookie</code> is blocked when you use HttpOnly. But it seems that you can still read cookie values in the XMLHttpRequest object, allowing for XSS. How does HttpOnly make you any safer than? By making cookies essentially read only? </p>

<p>In your example, I cannot write to your <code>document.cookie</code>, but I can still steal your cookie and post it to my domain using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var req = null;
    try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    if (!req) try { req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP""); } catch(e) {}
    req.open('GET', 'http://stackoverflow.com/', false);
    req.send(null);
    alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit 4:</em> Sorry, I meant that you could send the XMLHttpRequest to the StackOverflow domain, and then save the result of getAllResponseHeaders() to a string, regex out the cookie, and then post that to an external domain. It appears that Wikipedia and ha.ckers concur with me on this one, but I would love be re-educated...</p>

<p><em>Final Edit:</em> Ahh, apparently both sites are wrong, this is actually a <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380418"" rel=""noreferrer"">bug in FireFox</a>. IE6 &amp; 7 are actually the only browsers that currently fully support HttpOnly.</p>

<p>To reiterate everything I've learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>HttpOnly restricts all access to document.cookie in IE7 &amp; and FireFox (not sure about other browsers)</li>
<li>HttpOnly removes cookie information from the response headers in XMLHttpObject.getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7.</li>
<li>XMLHttpObjects may only be submitted to the domain they originated from, so there is no cross-domain posting of the cookies.</li>

<p>Using this method, however, leaves me with everything having the same precedence - it's evaluated left to right regardless of operator, although precedence can be enforced using parenthesis.</p>

<p>So right now ""1+11*5"" returns 60, not 56 as one might expect.</p>

<p>While this is suitable for the current project, I want to have a general purpose routine I can use for later projects.</p>

<p>What is a good algorithm for parsing equations with precedence?</p>

<p>I'm interested in something simple to implement and understand that I can code myself to avoid licensing issues with available code.</p>

<p><strong>Grammar:</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand the grammar question - I've written this by hand.  It's simple enough that I don't see the need for YACC or Bison.  I merely need to calculate strings with equations such as ""2+3 * (42/13)"".</p>

<p><strong>Language:</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing this in C, but I'm interested in an algorithm, not a language specific solution.  C is low level enough that it'll be easy to convert to another language should the need arise.</p>

<p>I posted the <a href=""http://www.ubasics.com/simple_c_equation_parser"" rel=""noreferrer"">test code for the simple expression parser</a> I was talking about above.  The project requirements altered and so I never needed to optimize the code for performance or space as it wasn't incorporated into the project.  It's in the original verbose form, and should be readily understandable.  If I do anything further with it in terms of operator precedence, I'll probably choose <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28256/equation-expression-parser-with-precedence/783132#783132"">the macro hack</a> because it matches the rest of the program in simplicity.

This is an example of what a call might look like:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: ""userCreation.ashx"",
    data: { u:userName, p:password, e:email },
    type: ""POST"",

            displayUserCreatedMessage();
            refreshUserList();
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The request might fail for a number of reasons, such as duplicate user name, duplicate email address etc, and the ashx is written to throw an exception when this happens.</p>

<p>My problem seems to be that by throwing an exception the ashx causes the <code>statusText</code> and <code>errorThrown</code> to be <strong>undefined</strong>.</p>

<p>I can get to the <code>XMLHttpRequest.responseText</code> which contains the HTML that makes up the standard .net error page.</p>

<p>I am finding the page title in the responseText and using the title to work out which error was thrown. Although I have a suspicion that this will fall apart when I enable custom error handling pages.</p>

<p>Should I be throwing the errors in the ashx, or should I be returning a status code as part of the data returned by the call to <code>userCreation.ashx</code>, then using this to decide what action to take?<br>

<p>I'm quite handy with SQL, and if somebody could point me to some FileMaker plug-in that could give me SQL access to the data within FileMaker, I would be pleased as punch. Everything I've found only goes the other way: Having FileMaker get data from SQL sources. Not useful.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: XML/XSLT services (as suggested by some folks) are only available on FM Server, not FM Pro. Otherwise, that would probably be the best solution. ODBC is turning out to be extremely difficult to even get working. There is absolutely zero feedback from FM when you set it up so you have to dig through /var/log/system.log and parse obscure error messages.</p>

<p><em>Conclusion</em>: I got it working by running a python script locally on the machine that queries the FM database through the ODBC connections. The script is actually a TCPServer that accepts socket connections from other systems on the LAN, runs the queries, and returns the data through the socket connection. I had to do this to bypass the fact that FM Pro only accepts ODBC connections locally (FM server is required for external connections).</p>

<p>Bruceatk kind of hit on what I'm thinking of; it's not so much the DB engine as I want the other niceties that Access brings to the party.  The nice form designer, the nice reporting engine etc.  But you do raise a very good point about the installation footprint.  I had considered that but I've not made any firm decisions about which way I'm going with this yet anyway.  It'll probably be something fairly lightweight anyway and a small installation footprint would definitely be a plus.</p>

<pre><code>public class Logger : StreamWriter
    {
        public string Buffer { get; private set; }
        public int QueryCounter { get; private set; }

        public Logger() : base(new MemoryStream())
        {}

        public override void Write(string value)
        {
            Buffer += value + ""&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"";
            if (!value.StartsWith(""--"")) QueryCounter++;
        }

        public override void WriteLine(string value)
        {
            Buffer += value + ""&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"";
            if (!value.StartsWith(""--"")) QueryCounter++;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the DataContext's constructor I setup the logger:</p>

<pre><code>public HeraldDBDataContext()
        : base(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""Herald""].ConnectionString, mappingSource)
    {
        Log = new Logger();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I use the <code>Application_OnEndRequest</code> event to add the results to the bottom of the page:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_OnEndRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Logger logger = DataContextFactory.Context.Log as Logger;

"29654","<p>I'm developing a WinForms application (.Net 3.5, no WPF) where I want to be able to display foreign key lookups in a databound DataGridView.  </p>

<p>An example of the sort of relationship is that I have a table of OrderLines. Orderlines have a foreign key relationship to Products and Products in turn have a foreign key relationship to ProductTypes.  </p>

<p>I'd like to have a databound DataGridView where each row represents an orderline, displaying the line's product and producttype.</p>

<p>Users can add or edit orderlines direct to the grid and choose the product for the order line from a comboBoxColumn - this should then update the producttype column, showing the producttype for the selected product, in the same row.</p>

<p>The closest to a good fit that I've found so far is to introduce a domain object representing an orderline then bind the DataGridView to a collection of these orderlines. I then add properties to the orderline object that expose the product and the producttype, and raise relevant notifypropertychanged events to keep everything up to date. In my orderline repository I can then wire up the mappings between this orderline object and the three tables in my database.</p>

<p>This works for the databinding side of things, but having to hand code all that OR-mapping in the repository seems bad. I thought nHibernate would be able to help with this wiring up but am struggling with the mappings through all the foreign keys - they seem to work ok (the foreignkey lookup for an orderline's product creates the correct product object based on the foreign key) until I try to do the databinding, I can't get the databound id columns to update my product or producttype objects.</p>

<p>Is my general approach even in the right ballpark? If it is, what is a good solution to the mapping problem?</p>

"30049","<p>I got embroiled in a discussion about DOM implementation quirks yesterday, with gave rise to an interesting question regarding Text.splitText and Element.normalise behaviours, and how they should behave.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DOM Level 1 Core</a>, Text.splitText is defined as...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breaks this Text node into two Text nodes at the specified offset, keeping both in the tree as siblings. This node then only contains all the content up to the offset point. And a new Text node, which is inserted as the next sibling of this node, contains all the content at and after the offset point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normalise is...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Puts all Text nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Element into a ""normal"" form where only markup (e.g., tags, comments, processing instructions, CDATA sections, and entity references) separates Text nodes, i.e., there are no adjacent Text nodes. This can be used to ensure that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded, and is useful when operations (such as XPointer lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if I take a text node containing ""Hello World"", referenced in textNode, and do</p>

<pre><code>textNode.splitText(3)
</code></pre>

<p>textNode now has the content ""Hello"", and a new sibling containing "" World""</p>

<p>If I then</p>

<pre><code>textNode.parent.normalize()
</code></pre>

<p><em>what is textNode</em>? The specification doesn't make it clear that textNode has to still be a child of it's previous parent, just updated to contain all adjacent text nodes (which are then removed). It seems to be to be a conforment behaviour to remove all the adjacent text nodes, and then recreate a new node with the concatenation of the values, leaving textNode pointing to something that is no longer part of the tree. Or, we can update textNode in the same fashion as in splitText, so it retains it's tree position, and gets a new value.</p>

<p>The choice of behaviour is really quite different, and I can't find a clarification on which is correct, or if this is simply an oversight in the specification (it doesn't seem to be clarified in levels 2 or 3). Can any DOM/XML gurus out there shed some light?</p>

Do you apply just common sense, do you do it always as a last resort? What are your strategies?</p>

<p>Edit: I'm sorry, seeing the answers I might have expressed the question badly (English is not my native language). I don't mean performance vs readability only <strong>after</strong> you've written the code, I ask about before you write it as well. Sometimes you can foresee a performance improvement in the future by making some darker design or providing with some properties that will make your class darker. You may decide you will use multiple threads or just a single one because you expect the scalability that such threads may give you, even when that will make the code much more difficult to understand.</p>

<p>A cursory search reveals <a href=""http://aspnetresources.com/blog/markdown_announced.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">a .NET Markdown to HTML converter</a>, and then we have <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/editor_in_windows_forms.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">a Windows Forms-based text editor that outputs HTML</a>, but apparently nothing that brings the two together. As a result, we'd still have our varchars with markup in there, but at least it would be both quite human-readable and still easily parseable.</p>

<p>Would this — a WYSIWYG editor that outputs Markdown, which is then later on parsed into HTML in ASP.NET — be feasible? Any alternative suggestions?</p>

"31059","<p>In VS .NET, when you are selecting a folder for a project, a dialog that looks like an OpenFileDialog or SaveFileDialog is displayed, but is set up to accept only folders.  Ever since I've seen this I've wanted to know how it's done.  I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog, but I've never really liked that dialog.  It starts too small and doesn't let me take advantage of being able to type a path.</p>

<p>I'm almost certain by now there's not a way to do this from .NET, but I'm just as curious how you do it from unmanaged code as well.  Short of completely reimplementing the dialog from scratch, how do you modify the dialog to have this behavior?</p>

<p>I'd also like to restate that I am aware of the FolderBrowserDialog but sometimes I don't like to use it, in addition to being genuinely curious how to configure a dialog in this manner.  Telling me to just use the FolderBrowserDialog helps me maintain a consistent UI experience but doesn't satisfy my curiosity so it won't count as an answer.</p>

<p>It's not a Vista-specific thing either; I've been seeing this dialog since VS .NET 2003, so it is doable in Win2k and WinXP.  This is less of a ""I want to know the proper way to do this"" question and more of a ""I have been curious about this since I first wanted to do it in VS 2003"" question.  I understand that Vista's file dialog has an option to do this, but it's been working in XP so I know they did <em>something</em> to get it to work.  Vista-specific answers are not answers, because Vista doesn't exist in the question context.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I'm accepting Scott Wisniewski's answer because it comes with a working sample, but I think Serge deserves credit for pointing to the dialog customization (which is admittedly nasty from .NET but it <em>does</em> work) and Mark Ransom for figuring out that MS probably rolled a custom dialog for this task.</strong></p>

"31412","<p>I am developing a GPL-licensed application in Python and need to know if the GPL allows my program to use proprietary plug-ins. This is <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">what the FSF has to say</a> on the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If a program released under the GPL uses plug-ins, what are the requirements for the licenses of a plug-in?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.</p>
<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.</p>
<p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial, doesn't carry over to interpreted languages: what about a Python/Perl/Ruby plugin, which gets loaded via <code>import</code> or <code>execfile</code>?</p>
<p>(edit: I understand why the distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, but it seems like someone who wanted to comply with the GPL but go against the &quot;spirit&quot; --I don't-- could just use fork/exec and interprocess communication to do pretty much anything).</p>
<p>The best solution would be to add an exception to my license to explicitly allow the use of proprietary plugins, but I am unable to do so since I'm using <a href=""http://trolltech.com/products/qt"" rel=""noreferrer"">Qt</a>/<a href=""http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyQt</a> which is GPL.</p>

"31498","<p>I have a generic class that should allow any type, primitive or otherwise. The only problem with this is using <code>default(T)</code>. When you call default on a value type or a string, it initializes it to a reasonable value (such as empty string). When you call <code>default(T)</code> on an object, it returns null. For various reasons we need to ensure that if it is not a primitive type, then we will have a default instance of the type, <strong>not</strong> null. Here is attempt 1:</p>

<pre><code>T createDefault()

<p>Problem - string is not a value type, but it does not have a parameterless constructor. So, the current solution is:</p>

"31567","<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around reflection, so I decided to add plugin capability to a program that I'm writing. The only way to understand a concept is to get your fingers dirty and write the code, so I went the route of creating a simple interface library consisting of the IPlugin and IHost interfaces, a plugin implementation library of classes that implement IPlugin, and a simple console project that instantiates the IHost implementation class that does simple work with the plugin objects. </p>

<p>Using reflection, I wanted to iterate through the types contained inside my plugin implementation dll and create instances of types.  I was able to sucessfully instantiate classes with this code, but I could not cast the created object to the interface.</p>

<p>I tried this code but I couldn't cast object o as I expected. I stepped through the process with the debugger and the proper constructor was called. Quickwatching object o showed me that it had the fields and properties that I expected to see in the implementation class. </p>

<pre><code>loop through assemblies
  loop through types in assembly
    // Filter out unwanted types
    if (!type.IsClass || type.IsNotPublic || type.IsAbstract )
      continue;
    // This successfully created the right object
    object o = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
    // This threw an Invalid Cast Exception or returned null for an ""as"" cast
    // even though the object implemented IPlugin      
    IPlugin i = (IPlugin) o;

And is the relationship linear, polynomial, or worse?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>In an article in IEEE Computer Magazine, vol 41 nr 9, sept 2008, the authors survey four popular XML parsing models (DOM, SAX, StAX and VTD). They run some very basic performance tests which show that a DOM-parser will have its throughput halved when the input file's size is increased from 1-15 KB to 1-15 MB, or about 1000x larger. The throughput of the other models is not significantly affected.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they did not perform more detailed studies, such as of throughput/memory usage as a function of number of nodes/size.</p>

<p>The article is <a href=""https://www.computer.org/10.1109/MC.2008.403"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I was unable to find any formal treatment of this problem. For what it's worth, I have done some experiments measuring the number of nodes in an XML document as a function of the document's size in bytes. I'm working on a warehouse management system and the XML documents are typical warehouse documents, e.g. advanced shipping notice etc.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the relationship between the size in bytes and the number of nodes (which should be proportional to the document's memory footprint under a DOM model). The different colors correspond to different kinds of documents. The scale is log/log. The black line is the best fit to the blue points. It's interesting to note that for all kinds of documents, the relationship between byte size and node size is linear, but that the coefficient of proportionality can be very different.</p>

     TcpListener serverSocket= new TcpListener(new IPEndPoint(bindAddress, port));

<p>then I run a loop putting all new connections as jobs in a separate thread pool. It gets more complicated because of the app architecture, but basically:</p>

<pre><code>   while (( socket = serverSocket.AcceptTcpClient()) !=null) //Funny exception here
    {
         connectionHandler = new ConnectionHandler(socket, mappingStrategy);
         pool.AddJob(connectionHandler);
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>From there, the <code>pool</code> has it's own threads that take care of each job in it's own thread, separately.</p>

<p>My understanding is that AcceptTcpClient() is a blocking call, and that somehow winsock is telling the thread to stop blocking and continue execution.. but why? And what am I supposed to do? Just catch the exception and ignore it? </p>

<hr>

<p>Well, I do think some other thread is closing the socket, but it's certainly not from my code. 
What I would like to know is: is this socket closed by the connecting client (on the other side of the socket) or is it closed by my server. Because as it is at this moment, whenever this exception occurs, it shutsdown my listening port, effectively closing my service. If this is done from a remote location, then it's a major problem. </p>

<p>Alternatively, could this be simply the IIS server shutting down my application, and thus cancelling all my background threads and blocking methods?</p>

"31913","<p>I'm sorry if my question is so long and technical but I think it's so important other people will be interested about it</p>

<p>I was looking for a way to separate clearly some softwares internals from their representation in c++</p>

<p>I have a generic parameter class (to be later stored in a container) that can contain any kind of value with the the boost::any class</p>

<p>I have a base class (roughly) of this kind (of course there is more stuff)</p>

<pre><code>class Parameter 
{
public:
    Parameter()
    template typename&lt;T&gt; T GetValue() const { return any_cast&lt;T&gt;( _value ); }
    template typename&lt;T&gt; void SetValue(const T&amp; value) { _value = value; }
    string GetValueAsString() const = 0;
    void SetValueFromString(const string&amp; str) const = 0;
private:
    boost::any _value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two levels of derived classes:
The first level defines the type and the conversion to/from string (for example ParameterInt or ParameterString)
The second level defines the behaviour and the real creators (for example deriving ParameterAnyInt and ParameterLimitedInt from ParameterInt or ParameterFilename from GenericString)</p>

<p>Depending on the real type I would like to add external function or classes that operates depending on the specific parameter type without adding virtual methods to the base class and without doing strange casts</p>

<p>For example I would like to create the proper gui controls depending on parameter types:</p>

<pre><code>Widget* CreateWidget(const Parameter&amp; p)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I cannot understand real Parameter type from this unless I use RTTI or implement it my self (with enum and switch case), but this is not the right OOP design solution, you know.</p>

<p>The classical solution is the Visitor design pattern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern</a></p>

<p>The problem with this pattern is that I have to know in advance which derived types will be implemented, so (putting together what is written in wikipedia and my code) we'll have sort of: </p>

<pre><code>struct Visitor 
{
  virtual void visit(ParameterLimitedInt&amp; wheel) = 0;
  virtual void visit(ParameterAnyInt&amp; engine) = 0;
  virtual void visit(ParameterFilename&amp; body) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any solution to obtain this behaviour in any other way without need to know in advance all the concrete types and without deriving the original visitor?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/31913"">Dr. Pizza's solution seems the closest to what I was thinking</a>, but the problem is still the same and the method is actually relying on dynamic_cast, that I was trying to avoid as a kind of (even if weak) RTTI method</p>

<p>Maybe it is better to think to some solution without even citing the visitor Pattern and clean our mind. The purpose is just having the function such:</p>

"31919","<p>I'm comparing it Java where you can start your application server in debug mode, then attach your IDE to the server. And you can change your code ""on the fly"" without restarting the server. As long as your changes don't affect any method signatures or fields you can just hit recompile for a class and the application server (servlet container) will reload the class.</p>

<p>I suppose this is impossible in ASP.NET since all classes are packed into assemblies and you cannot unload/reload assemblies, can you ?</p>

<p>So when you have an .aspx page and an assembly deployed to GAC and your codebehind changes you have to redeploy the assembly and reset IIS. I'm talking about Sharepoint applications in particular and I'm not sure whether you have to do iisreset for private assemblies but I guess you have too.</p>

<p>So the best way to debug aspx pages with code behind I guess would be to get rid of the codebehind for the time of active debugging and move into the page, then when it is more or less working move it back to codebehind.

<p>I didn't want to just dump a bunch of code in the question so I've posted the code for the class on <code>refactormycode</code>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.refactormycode.com/codes/461-base-class-for-easy-class-property-handling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">base class for easy class property handling</a></strong></p>

<p>My thought was that people can either post code snippets here or make changes on <code>refactormycode</code> and post links back to their refactorings.  I'll make upvotes and accept an answer (assuming there's a clear ""winner"") based on that.</p>

<p>At any rate, on to the class itself:</p>

<p>I see a lot of debate about getter/setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get/set methods defined, blah blah blah.  I like the idea of having explicit methods in case you have to add more logic later.  Then you don't have to modify any code that uses the class.  However I hate having a million functions that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function getFirstName()
{
   return $this-&gt;firstName;
}
public function setFirstName($firstName)
{
   return $this-&gt;firstName;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm sure I'm not the first person to do this (I'm hoping that there's a better way of doing it that someone can suggest to me).</p>

<p>Basically, the PropertyHandler class has a __call magic method.  Any methods that come through __call that start with ""get"" or ""set"" are then routed to functions that set or retrieve values into an associative array.  The key into the array is the name of the calling method after getting or setting.  So, if the method coming into __call is ""getFirstName"", the array key is ""FirstName"".</p>

<p>I liked using __call because it will automatically take care of the case where the subclass already has a ""getFirstName"" method defined.  My impression (and I may be wrong) is that the __get &amp; __set magic methods don't do that.</p>

<p>So here's an example of how it would work:</p>

<pre><code>class PropTest extends PropertyHandler
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }
}

$props = new PropTest();

$props-&gt;setFirstName(""Mark"");
echo $props-&gt;getFirstName();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that PropTest doesn't actually have ""setFirstName"" or ""getFirstName"" methods and neither does PropertyHandler.  All that's doing is manipulating array values.</p>

<p>The other case would be where your subclass is already extending something else.  Since you can't have true multiple inheritances in PHP, you can make your subclass have a PropertyHandler instance as a private variable.  You have to add one more function but then things behave in exactly the same way.</p>

<pre><code>class PropTest2
{
    private $props;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;props = new PropertyHandler();
    }

    public function __call($method, $arguments)
    {
        return $this-&gt;props-&gt;__call($method, $arguments);
    }
}

$props2 = new PropTest2();

$props2-&gt;setFirstName('Mark');
echo $props2-&gt;getFirstName();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the subclass has a __call method that just passes everything along to the PropertyHandler __call method.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another good argument against handling getters and setters this way is that it makes it really hard to document.</p>

<p>In fact, it's basically impossible to use any sort of document generation tool since the explicit methods to be don't documented don't exist.</p>

<p>I've pretty much abandoned this approach for now. It was an interesting learning exercise but I think it sacrifices too much clarity.</p>

<p>One discussion is regarding passing nulls into a method.</p>

<pre><code>public class MetricsCalculator {
    public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
        return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
    }
}
...
calculator.xProjection(null, new Point(12,13));
</code></pre>

<p>It represents different ways of handling this:</p>

<pre><code>public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid argument for xProjection"");
    }
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}

public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    assert p1 != null : ""p1 should not be null"";
    assert p2 != null : ""p2 should not be null"";
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">assertions</a> approach, but I don't like the fact that assertions are turned off by default.</p>

<p>The book finally states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is passed by a caller accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid passing null by default.</p>

What I'm wondering is why the C++ <code>std::fstream</code> classes don't take a <code>std::string</code> in their constructor or open methods. Everyone loves code examples so:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
    std::string filename = ""testfile"";

    fin.open(filename.c_str()); // Works just fine.
    fin.close();

    //fin.open(filename); // Error: no such method.
    //fin.close();
}

<p>This gets me all the time when working with files. Surely the C++ library would use <code>std::string</code> wherever possible?</p>

<p>** Original question: **</p>

<p>One thing that concerns me as a security professional is that Ruby doesn't have a parallel of Java's package-privacy.  That is, this isn't valid Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>public module Foo
  public module Bar
    # factory method for new Bar implementations
    def self.new(...)
      SimpleBarImplementation.new(...)
    end
    def baz
      raise NotImplementedError.new('Implementing Classes MUST redefine #baz')
    end
  end

  private class SimpleBarImplementation
    include Bar
    def baz
      ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>It'd be really nice to be able to prevent monkey-patching of Foo::BarImpl.  That way, people who rely on the library know that nobody has messed with it.  Imagine if somebody changed the implementation of MD5 or SHA1 on you!  I can call <code>freeze</code> on these classes, but I have to do it on a class-by-class basis, and other scripts might modify them before I finish securing my application if I'm not <strong>very</strong> careful about load order.</p>

<p>Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming, many of which are not possible in Ruby.  (See Josh Bloch's book for a good list.)  Is this really a concern?  Should I just stop complaining and use Ruby for lightweight things and not hope for ""enterprise-ready"" solutions?</p>

<p>(And no, core classes are not frozen by default in Ruby.  See below:)</p>

Ordinarily I would encode the files one at a time, but let's say I wanted the program to figure out how many CPU cores I had and spin up an encoding thread on each core. So, when I run the program on a quad core CPU, the program figures out it's a quad core CPU, figures out there are four cores to work with, then spawns four threads for the encoding, each of which is running on its own separate CPU. How would I do this?</p>

<p>And would this be any different if the cores were spread out across multiple physical CPUs? As in, if I had a machine with two quad core CPUs on it, are there any special considerations or are the eight cores across the two dies considered equal in Windows?</p>

"32377","<p>We're trying to figure out the best way to write tests in our test plan.  Specifically, when writing a test that is meant to be used by anyone including QA staff, should the steps in the test be very specific or more broad giving the tester more leeway in how the task can be accomplished.  As a very simple example, if you're testing opening a document in word processing document, should the test read:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the mouse, open the file menu</li>
<li>Choose ""Open File..."" in the file menu</li>
<li>In the open file dialog that appears, navigate to x and double-click the document called y</li>

<li>Open the file y</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I realize one answer is probably going to be ""it depends on what you're trying to test"" but I'm trying to answer a broader question here: If the test steps are too specific do we risk a) making the testing process to laborious and tedious and more importantly b) do we risk missing something because we wrote down too specific a path to achieve a goal.  Alternatively, if we make it broad do we depend too much on the whims of the tester at the time and lose crucial testing of paths that are more common to customers/clients?</p>

"32412","<p>I've been tasked with the the maintenance of a nonprofit website that recently fell victim to a SQL injection attack. Someone exploited a form on the site to add text to every available text-like field in the database (varchar, nvarchar, etc.) which, when rendered as HTML, includes and executes a JavaScript file. </p>

<p>A Google search of the URL indicates that it's from email spammers based out of Romania or China, but that's not what's important right now.</p>

<p>Obviously there's more that needs to be done (hardening the site against SQL injections, using something like markdown instead of storing HTML, etc.) and I am working on those but for the time being what I really need is a good way to go in and programmatically remove the injected text. I know what the exact text is, it's the same every time, and it's always appended to the end of any text field. I can't afford to strip out all HTML in the database at this time and I don't know when this happened exactly so I can't just roll back to a backup. Also, the site is on shared hosting and I cannot connect to the database directly with SQL Server tools. I can execute queries against it though, so if there's any way of constructing a SQL update statement to the effect of ""hey find all the text fields in all of the tables in the entire database and do this to clean them"" that would be the best. </p>

"32414","<p>We are currently working in a private beta and so are still in the process of making fairly rapid changes, although obviously as usage is starting to ramp up, we will be slowing down this process.  That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd> refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.</p>

<p>Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.</p>

"32744","<p>For the past few weeks, I've been trying to learn about just how email works.  I understand the process of a client receiving mail from a server using POP pretty well.  I also understand how a client computer can use SMTP to ask an SMTP server to send a message.  However, I'm still missing something...</p>

<p>The way I understand it, outgoing mail has to make three trips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client (gmail user using Thunderbird) to a server (Gmail)</li>
<li>First server (Gmail) to second server (Hotmail)</li>
<li>Second server (Hotmail) to second client (hotmail user using OS X Mail)</li>
</ol>

<p>As I understand it, step one uses SMTP for the client to communicate.  The client authenticates itself somehow (say, with USER and PASS), and then sends a message to the gmail server.</p>

<p>However, I don't understand how gmail server transfers the message to the hotmail server.</p>

<p>For step three, I'm pretty sure, the hotmail server uses POP to send the message to the hotmail client (using authentication, again).</p>

<p>So, the big question is: <strong>when I click send Mail sends my message to my gmail server, how does my gmail server forward the message to, say, a hotmail server so my friend can recieve it?</strong></p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>~Jason</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks, that's been helpful so far.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the first client sends the message to the first server using SMTP, often to an address such as smtp.mail.SOMESERVER.com on port 25 (usually).</p>

<p>Then, SOMESERVER uses SMTP again to send the message to RECEIVESERVER.com on port 25 (not smtp.mail.RECEIVESERVER.com or anything fancy).</p>

<p>Then, when the recipient asks RECEIVESERVER for its mail, using POP, s/he recieves the message... right?</p>

<p>Thanks again (especially to dr-jan),</p>

"32824","<p>While writing a custom IHttpHandler I came across a behavior that I didn't expect concerning the HttpCachePolicy object.</p>

<p>My handler calculates and sets an entity-tag (using the SetETag method on the HttpCachePolicy associated with the current response object). If I set the cache-control to public using the SetCacheability method everything works like a charm and the server sends along the e-tag header. If I set it to private the e-tag header will be suppressed.</p>

<p>Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough but I haven't seen anything in the HTTP/1.1 spec that would justify this behavior. Why wouldn't you want to send E-Tag to browsers while still prohibiting proxies from storing the data?</p>

using System.Web;

public class Handler : IHttpHandler {
    public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext ctx) {
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private);
        ctx.Response.Cache.SetETag(""\""static\"""");
        ctx.Response.ContentType = ""text/plain"";
        ctx.Response.Write(""Hello World"");

<p>I've run this on the ASP.NET development server and IIS6 so far with the same results. Also I'm unable to explicitly set the ETag using</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It's possible to append the ETag header manually when running in IIS7, I suspect this is caused by the tight integration between ASP.NET and the IIS7 pipeline.</p>

This seems a little kludgy to me, because we are planning on storing the files in the db, but I haven't had to scan files for viruses before.

"33117","<p>Can anyone point me to a good tutorial on creating a bootable Linux CD from scratch?</p>
<p>I need help with a fairly specialized problem: my firm sells an expansion card that requires custom firmware. Currently we use an extremely old live CD image of RH7.2 that we update with current firmware. Manufacturing puts the cards in a machine, boots off the CD, the CD writes the firmware, they power off and pull the cards. Because of this cycle, it's essential that the CD boot and shut down as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The problem is that with the next generation of cards, I have to update the CD to a 2.6 kernel. It's easy enough to acquire a pre-existing live CD - but those all are designed for showing off Linux on the desktop - which means they take forever to boot.</p>

"33265","<p>There are two weird operators in C#:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6x6y6z4d.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">true operator</a></li>
<li>the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6292hy1k.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">false operator</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I understand this right these operators can be used in types which I want to use instead of a boolean expression and where I don't want to provide an implicit conversion to bool.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a following class:</p>

<pre><code>    public class MyType
    {
        public readonly int Value;

        public MyType(int value)
        {
            Value = value;
        }

        public static bool operator true (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &gt; 0;
        }

        public static bool operator false (MyType mt)
        {
            return  mt.Value &lt; 0;
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>So I can write the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    MyType mTrue = new MyType(100);
    MyType mFalse = new MyType(-100);
    MyType mDontKnow = new MyType(0);

    if (mTrue)
    {
         // Do something.
    }

    while (mFalse)
    {
        // Do something else.
    }

    do
    {
        // Another code comes here.
    } while (mDontKnow)
</code></pre>

<p>However for all the examples above only the true operator is executed. So what's the false operator in C# good for?</p>

<p>Things like, for example, if it takes a lot of time to instance/GC a List, but not much to clear it, maybe I should keep a little pool of Lists waiting for me, and clear them and send them back to the pool when done, instead of simply dereferencing them.</p>

<p>Or, if Hashtables are faster for access but waste a lot of memory, I might prefer to use Lists and traverse them, for small item counts.</p>

<p>At first I implemented this using a TRY CATCH in a local SQL 2005 instance (to get the project going) and all was working well, but i learned today that the dev &amp; production database that the international DBA's have set up is a SQL 2000 instance so I have to conform.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I am using a SSIS package to populate the staging table. I see that now I must revisit that package and implement a script component to handle the conversions. Thanks guys</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I <em>am</em> doing this on a record by record basis, not a batch insert, so the transaction idea seems like it would be feasible but I'm not sure how to trap @@ERROR and allow the stored procedure to continue.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I really like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33685/sql-2000-try-catch-like-error-handling#39161"">Guy's approach</a>, I am going to implement it this way.</p>

"33746","<p>At work we are being asked to create XML files to pass data to another offline application that will then create a second XML file to pass back in order to update some of our data. During the process we have been discussing with the team of the other application about the structure of the XML file. </p>

<p>The sample I came up with is essentially something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;INVENTORY&gt;
   &lt;ITEM serialNumber=""something"" location=""something"" barcode=""something""&gt;
      &lt;TYPE modelNumber=""something"" vendor=""something""/&gt; 
   &lt;/ITEM&gt;
&lt;/INVENTORY&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The other team said that this was not industry standard and that attributes should only be used for meta data. They suggested:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;INVENTORY&gt;
   &lt;ITEM&gt;
      &lt;SERIALNUMBER&gt;something&lt;/SERIALNUMBER&gt;

Their suggestion in reality turns out to be three times larger than the one I suggested. I searched for the mysterious ""Industry Standard"" that was mentioned, but the closest I could find was that XML attributes should only be used for meta data, but said the debate was about what was actually meta data.</p>

"33860","<p>In Ruby on Rails, I'm attempting to update the <code>innerHTML</code> of a div tag using the <code>form_remote_tag</code> helper.  This update happens whenever an associated select tag receives an onchange event.  The problem is, <code>&lt;select onchange=""this.form.submit();""&gt;</code>; doesn't work.  Nor does <code>document.forms[0].submit()</code>.  The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button, and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag.  Here's a working ERb partial example.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&gt; product_path, :update =&gt; 'content', :method =&gt; 'get' do -%&gt;
  &lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&gt; 'content' do -%&gt;
    &lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([[""foo"", 1], [""bar"", 2]]), :onchange =&gt; ""this.form.commit.click"" %&gt;
    &lt;%= submit_tag 'submit_button', :style =&gt; ""display: none"" %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is something like this, but it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_remote_tag :url =&gt; product_path, :update =&gt; 'content', :method =&gt; 'get' do -%&gt;
  &lt;% content_tag :div, :id =&gt; 'content' do -%&gt;
    # the following line does not work
    &lt;%= select_tag :update, options_for_select([[""foo"", 1], [""bar"", 2]]), :onchange =&gt; ""this.form.onsubmit()"" %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case?</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion.  So, let me explain.  The basic problem is that <code>submit()</code> doesn't call the <code>onsubmit()</code> code rendered into the form.</p>

<p>The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/products/1"" method=""post"" onsubmit=""new Ajax.Updater('content', '/products/1', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get', parameters:Form.serialize(this)}); return false;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""margin:0;padding:0""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""authenticity_token"" type=""hidden"" value=""4eacf78eb87e9262a0b631a8a6e417e9a5957cab"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;select id=""update"" name=""update"" onchange=""this.form.commit.click""&gt;
      &lt;option value=""1""&gt;foo&lt;/option&gt;
      &lt;option value=""2""&gt;bar&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input name=""commit"" style=""display: none"" type=""submit"" value=""submit_button"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to axe the invisible submit button, but using a straight form.submit appears to not work.  So, I need some way to call the form's onsubmit event code.</p>

<p>Update: Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn't a <code>return(false);</code> generated by Rails.  I'm not sure which is worse though, sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the <code>getAttribute('onsubmit')</code> call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement!   </p>

<p>How do I go about telling the compiler to do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC: <code>/O2</code> or <code>/Ox</code></li>
<li>For GCC: <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code></li>
</ul>

<p>How about checking if the compiler has done this in a certain case?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC, enable PDB output to be able to trace the code, then inspect the code</li>
<li>For GCC..?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd still take suggestions for how to determine if a certain function is optimized like this by the compiler (even though I find it reassuring that Konrad tells me to assume it)</p>

<p>It is always possible to check if the compiler does this at all by making an infinite recursion and checking if it results in an infinite loop or a stack overflow (I did this with GCC and found out that <code>-O2</code> is sufficient), but I want to be able to check a certain function that I know will terminate anyway. I'd love to have an easy way of checking this :)</p>

<hr>

<p>After some testing, I discovered that destructors ruin the possibility of making this optimization. It can sometimes be worth it to change the scoping of certain variables and temporaries to make sure they go out of scope before the return-statement starts.</p>

<p>If any destructor needs to be run after the tail-call, the tail-call optimization can not be done.</p>

"34126","<p>I see 2 main ways to set events in JavaScript:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add an event directly inside the tag like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href="""" onclick=""doFoo()""&gt;do foo&lt;/a&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Set them by JavaScript like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a id=""bar"" href=""""&gt;do bar&lt;/a&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>and add an event in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> section inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section or in an external JavaScript file, like that if you're using <strong>prototypeJS</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Event.observe(window, 'load', function() {
    $('bar').observe('click', doBar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the first method is easier to read and maintain (because the JavaScript action is directly bound to the link) but it's not so clean (because users can click on the link even if the page is not fully loaded, which may cause JavaScript errors in some cases).</p>

<p>The second method is cleaner (actions are added when the page is fully loaded) but it's more difficult to know that an action is linked to the tag.</p>

<p>One by one (from prisoner #1 to prisoner #100, in order), they will be let into a room B in which 100 boxes (numbered from 1 to 100) await them. Inside the (closed) boxes are numbers from 1 to 100 (the numbers inside the boxes are randomly permuted!).</p>

<p>Once inside room B, each prisoner gets to open 50 boxes (he chooses which one he opens). If he finds the number that was assigned to him in one of these 50 boxes, the prisoner gets to walk into a room C and all boxes are closed again before the next one walks into room B from room A. Otherwise, all prisoners (in rooms A, B and C) gets killed.</p>

"34509","<p>We have a large database on which we have DB side pagination. This is quick, returning a page of 50 rows from millions of records in a small fraction of a second.</p>

<p>Users can define their own sort, basically choosing what column to sort by.  Columns are dynamic - some have numeric values, some dates and some text.</p>

<p>While most sort as expected text sorts in a dumb way. Well, I say dumb, it makes sense to computers, but frustrates users.</p>

<p>For instance, sorting by a string record id gives something like:</p>

<pre><code>rec1
rec10
rec14
rec2
rec20
rec3
rec4
</code></pre>

<p>...and so on.</p>

<p>I want this to take account of the number, so:</p>

<pre><code>rec1
rec2
rec3
rec4
rec10
rec14
rec20
</code></pre>

<p>I can't control the input (otherwise I'd just format in leading 000s) and I can't rely on a single format - some are things like ""{alpha code}-{dept code}-{rec id}"".</p>

<p>I know a few ways to do this in C#, but can't pull down all the records to sort them, as that would be to slow.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a way to quickly apply a natural sort in Sql server?</p>

<hr>

<p>We're using:</p>

<pre><code>ROW_NUMBER() over (order by {field name} asc)
</code></pre>

<p>And then we're paging by that.</p>

<p>We can add triggers, although we wouldn't. All their input is parametrised and the like, but I can't change the format - if they put in ""rec2"" and ""rec10"" they expect them to be returned just like that, and in natural order.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have valid user input that follows different formats for different clients.</p>

<p>One might go rec1, rec2, rec3, ... rec100, rec101</p>

<p>While another might go: grp1rec1, grp1rec2, ... grp20rec300, grp20rec301</p>

<p>When I say we can't control the input I mean that we can't force users to change these standards - they have a value like grp1rec1 and I can't reformat it as grp01rec001, as that would be changing something used for lookups and linking to external systems.</p>

<p>These formats vary a lot, but are often mixtures of letters and numbers.</p>

<p>Sorting these in C# is easy - just break it up into <code>{ ""grp"", 20, ""rec"", 301 }</code> and then compare sequence values in turn.</p>

<p>However there may be millions of records and the data is paged, I need the sort to be done on the SQL server.</p>

<p>SQL server sorts by value, not comparison - in C# I can split the values out to compare, but in SQL I need some logic that (very quickly) gets a single value that consistently sorts.</p>

<p>@moebius - your answer might work, but it does feel like an ugly compromise to add a sort-key for all these text values.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. The <code>float:left</code> works beautifully with expected results in FF 3.1. Unfortunately, in IE6 the right side span renders 50% of the 50%, in effect giving it a width of 25% of the browser window. Setting its width to 100% achieves the desired results but breaks in FF 3.1 which is in standards compliance mode and I understand that.

<p>Here's what we ended up doing:</p>

<p>We pulled a unique sequential 32bit id from the database.  We then inserted it into the center bits of a 64bit RANDOM integer.  We created a lookup table of easily typed and recognized characters (A-Z, a-z, 2-9 skipping easily confused characters such as L,l,1,O,0, etc.).  Finally, we used that lookup table to base-54 encode the 64-bit integer.  The high bits were random, the low bits were random, but the center bits were sequential.</p>

<p>The final result was a code that was much smaller than a guid and looked random, even though it absolutely wasn't.</p>

The encoder is a mechanical <a href=""http://no.farnell.com/1520815/passives/product.us0?sku=alps-ec12d1524401"" rel=""noreferrer"">ALPS encoder</a>, and I'm using <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2545.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Atmega168</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>I have tried using an External Interrupt to listen to the pins, but it seems like it is too slow. When Pin A goes high, the interrupt procedure starts and then checks if Pin B is high. The idea is that if Pin B is high the moment Pin A went high, then it is rotating counter clock-wise. If Pin B is low, then it is rotating clock-wise. But it seems like the AVR takes too long to check Pin B, so it is always read as high. </p>

<p>I've also tried to create a program that simply blocks until Pin B or Pin A changes. But it might be that there is too much noise when the encoder is rotated, because this does not work either. My last attempt was to have a timer which stores the last 8 values in a buffer and checks if it is going from low to high. This did not work either.</p>

<p>I have tried scoping the encoder, and it seems to use between 2 and 4ms from the first Pin changes till the other Pin changes.</p>

Maybe there are also some other approaches I haven't though of in addition to these.

"34925","<p>I've seen quite a few posts on changes in .NET 3.5 SP1, but stumbled into one that I've yet to see documentation for yesterday.  I had code working just fine on my machine, from VS, msbuild command line, everything, but it failed on the build server (running .NET 3.5 RTM).</p>

<pre><code>[XmlRoot(""foo"")]
public class Foo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Foo));

        string xml = @""&lt;foo name='ack' /&gt;"";
        using (StringReader sr = new StringReader(xml))
        {
            Foo foo = serializer.Deserialize(sr) as Foo;
        }
    }

    [XmlAttribute(""name"")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Foo Bar { get; private set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In SP1, the above code runs just fine. In RTM, you get an InvalidOperationException:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to generate a temporary class (result=1).
  error CS0200: Property or indexer 'ConsoleApplication2.Foo.Bar' cannot be assign to -- it is read only</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, all that's needed to make it run under RTM is adding [XmlIgnore] to the Bar property.</p>

<p>My google fu is apparently not up to finding documentation of these kinds of changes. Is there a change list anywhere that lists this change (and similar under-the-hood changes that might jump up and shout ""gotcha"")?  Is this a bug or a feature? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: In SP1, if I added a <code>&lt;Bar /&gt;</code> element, or set [XmlElement] for the Bar property, it won't get deserialized.  It doesn't fail pre-SP1 when it tries to deserialize--it throws an exception when the XmlSerializer is constructed.</p>

<p>This makes me lean more toward it being a bug, especially if I set an [XmlElement] attribute for Foo.Bar. If it's unable to do what I ask it to do, it should be throwing an exception instead of silently ignoring Foo.Bar.  Other invalid combinations/settings of XML serialization attributes result in an exception.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thank you, TonyB, I'd not known about setting the temp files location. For those that come across similar issues in the future, you do need an additional config flag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
  &lt;switches&gt;
    &lt;add name=""XmlSerialization.Compilation"" value=""1"" /&gt;
  &lt;/switches&gt;
&lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;
&lt;system.xml.serialization&gt;
  &lt;xmlSerializer tempFilesLocation=""c:\\foo""/&gt;
&lt;/system.xml.serialization&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Even with setting an [XmlElement] attribute on the Bar property, no mention was made of it in the generated serialization assembly--which fairly firmly puts this in the realm of a silently swallowed error (aka, a bug). Either that or the designers have decided [XmlIgnore] is no longer necessary for properties that can't be set--and you'd expect to see that in release notes, <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951847"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">change lists</a>, or the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlignoreattribute.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XmlIgnoreAttribute documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I am working on a site that will allow the user to download very large files (up to and exceeding 100GB)</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this <strong><em>without using FTP</em></strong>.  The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don't think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won't cut it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a ""browser wide"" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I'm trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn't going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren't going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren't talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>

<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution. The only problem is that it doesn't work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere which is exceeded/overflown by the content length of the file).</p>

<p>The best solution would be a java applet or ActiveX component, since the problem only exist in IE, that would work like the article @spoulson linked to. However, so far I haven't had any luck finding a solution that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>

<p>It looks like we might have to write our own. Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works. The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>

Signed is not the same as unsigned, <code>sdivdi3()</code> does not simply call <code>udivdi3()</code>, they are separate functions for a reason.</p>

I was already thinking this was too good to be true when I saw this in the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syncdb will not alter existing tables</p>
<p>syncdb will only create tables for models which have not yet been installed. It will never issue ALTER TABLE statements to match changes made to a model class after installation. Changes to model classes and database schemas often involve some form of ambiguity and, in those cases, Django would have to guess at the correct changes to make. There is a risk that critical data would be lost in the process.</p>
<p>If you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match, use the sql command to display the new SQL structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes.</p>

"36014","<p>I'm working on a project using the <a href=""http://antlr.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">ANTLR</a> parser library for C#.  I've built a grammar to parse some text and it works well.  However, when the parser comes across an illegal or unexpected token, it throws one of many exceptions.  The problem is that in some cases (not all) that my try/catch block won't catch it and instead stops execution as an unhandled exception.</p>

<p>The issue for me is that I can't replicate this issue anywhere else but in my full code.  The call stack shows that the exception definitely occurs within my try/catch(Exception) block.  The only thing I can think of is that there are a few ANTLR assembly calls that occur between my code and the code throwing the exception and this library does not have debugging enabled, so I can't step through it.  I wonder if non-debuggable assemblies inhibit exception bubbling?  The call stack looks like this; external assembly calls are in Antlr.Runtime:</p>

<pre>
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefLexer.mTokens() Line 1213 C#
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.Lexer.NextToken() + 0xfc bytes 
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.FillBuffer() + 0x22c bytes   
    Antlr3.Runtime.dll!Antlr.Runtime.CommonTokenStream.LT(int k = 1) + 0x68 bytes
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!TimeDefParser.prog() Line 109 + 0x17 bytes   C#
    Expl.Itinerary.dll!Expl.Itinerary.TDLParser.Parse(string Text = """", Expl.Itinerary.IItinerary Itinerary = {Expl.Itinerary.MemoryItinerary}) Line 17 + 0xa bytes C#
</pre>

<p>The code snippet from the bottom-most call in Parse() looks like:</p>

<pre><code>     try {
        // Execution stopped at parser.prog()
        TimeDefParser.prog_return prog_ret = parser.prog();
        return prog_ret == null ? null : prog_ret.value;
     }
     catch (Exception ex) {
        throw new ParserException(ex.Message, ex);
     }
</code></pre>

<p>To me, a catch (Exception) clause should've captured any exception whatsoever.  Is there any reason why it wouldn't?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I traced through the external assembly with Reflector and found no evidence of threading whatsoever.  The assembly seems to just be a runtime utility class for ANTLR's generated code.  The exception thrown is from the TimeDefLexer.mTokens() method and its type is NoViableAltException, which derives from RecognitionException -> Exception.  This exception is thrown when the lexer cannot understand the next token in the stream; in other words, invalid input.  This exception is SUPPOSED to happen, however it should've been caught by my try/catch block.</p>

<p>Also, the rethrowing of ParserException is really irrelevant to this situation.  That is a layer of abstraction that takes any exception during parse and convert to my own ParserException.  The exception handling problem I'm experiencing is never reaching that line of code.  In fact, I commented out the ""throw new ParserException"" portion and still received the same result.</p>

<p>One more thing, I modified the original try/catch block in question to instead catch NoViableAltException, eliminating any inheritance confusion.  I still received the same result.</p>

<p>Someone once suggested that sometimes VS is overactive on catching handled exceptions when in debug mode, but this issue also happens in release mode.</p>

<p>Man, I'm still stumped!  I hadn't mentioned it before, but I'm running VS 2008 and all my code is 3.5.  The external assembly is 2.0.  Also, some of my code subclasses a class in the 2.0 assembly.  Could a version mismatch cause this issue?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I was able to eliminate the .NET version conflict by porting relevant portions of my .NET 3.5 code to a .NET 2.0 project and replicate the same scenario.  I was able to replicate the same unhandled exception when running consistently in .NET 2.0.</p>

<p>I learned that ANTLR has recently released 3.1.  So, I upgraded from 3.0.1 and retried.  It turns out the generated code is a little refactored, but the same unhandled exception occurs in my test cases.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong>
I've replicated this scenario in a <a href=""http://www.explodingcoder.com/cms/files/TestAntlr-3.1.zip"" rel=""noreferrer"">simplified VS 2008 project</a>.  Feel free to download and inspect the project for yourself.  I've applied all the great suggestions, but have not been able to overcome this obstacle yet.</p>

<p>If you can find a workaround, please do share your findings.  Thanks again!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you, but VS 2008 automatically breaks on unhandled exceptions.  Also, I don't have a Debug->Exceptions dialog.  The NoViableAltException that is thrown is fully intended, and designed to be caught by user code.  Since it is not caught as expected, program execution halts unexpectedly as an unhandled exception.</p>

<p>The exception thrown is derived from Exception and there is no multi-threading going on with ANTLR.</p>

"36077","<p>I'm looking for an answer in MS VC++.</p>

<p>When debugging a large C++ application, which unfortunately has a very extensive usage of C++ exceptions. Sometimes I catch an exception a little later than I actually want.</p>

<p>Example in pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>FunctionB()
{
    ...
    throw e;
    ...
}

FunctionA()
{
    ...
    FunctionB()
    ...
}

try
{
    Function A()
}
catch(e)
{
    (&lt;--- breakpoint)
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can catch the exception with a breakpoint when debugging. But I can't trace back if the exception occurred in <code>FunctionA()</code> or <code>FunctionB()</code>, or some other function. (Assuming extensive exception use and a huge version of the above example).</p>

<p>One solution to my problem is to determine and save the call stack <strong>in the exception constructor</strong> (i.e. before it is caught). But this would require me to derive all exceptions from this base exception class. It would also require a lot of code, and perhaps slow down my program.</p>

<p>Is there an easier way that requires less work?  Without having to change my large code base?</p>

"36106","<p>I have an information retrieval application that creates bit arrays on the order of 10s of million bits. The number of ""set"" bits in the array varies widely, from all clear to all set. Currently, I'm using a straight-forward bit array (<code>java.util.BitSet</code>), so each of my bit arrays takes several megabytes.</p>

<p>My plan is to look at the cardinality of the first <em>N</em> bits, then make a decision about what data structure to use for the remainder. Clearly some data structures are better for very sparse bit arrays, and others when roughly half the bits are set (when most bits are set, I can use negation to treat it as a sparse set of zeroes). </p>

<ul>
<li>What structures might be good at each extreme? </li>
<li>Are there any in the middle?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few constraints or hints:</p>

<ol>
<li>The bits are set only once, and in index order.</li>
<li>I need 100% accuracy, so something like a Bloom filter isn't good enough.</li>
<li>After the set is built, I need to be able to efficiently iterate over the ""set"" bits.</li>
<li>The bits are randomly distributed, so run-length&ndash;encoding algorithms aren't likely to be much better than a simple list of bit indexes.</li>
<li>I'm trying to optimize memory utilization, but speed still carries <em>some</em> weight.</li>

"36197","<p>So I'm embarking on an <code>ASP.NET MVC</code> project and while the experience has been a good one overall, I'm not quite as pleased with the spaghetti mess that my controllers have become. I've looked around online (CodeCampServer, etc...) and they all seem to suffer the same issue wherein controller methods violate SRP (single responsibility principle) pretty consistently - such as a controller method that simply renders the view if the request is a <code>GET</code> but updates the <code>model</code> if it's a <code>POST</code>. Now I've got controller methods responsible for multiple logical routes throughout the application - say it checks for which <code>button</code> was clicked on the form and acts accordingly. I could redirect each button click to a different form action using JavaScript, but something doesn't feel right there either... The other big issue is the proliferation of magic <code>strings - ViewData[""foo""] = blah;</code> Long story short, how do you guys <code>structure</code> your <code>controller</code> logic? One giant model object per view? Lots of little <code>controller methods</code> and <code>JavaScript</code> is the router?

<p>I think everyone who encountered this behavior for the first time was surprised but on second thought it made sense:</p>

<p>As long as the derived constructor has not been executed the object is <strong>not</strong> yet a <em>derived</em> instance.</p>

<p>So how can a derived function be called? The preconditions haven't had the chance to be set up. Example:</p>

    base()

public:

    // The following cannot be called before derived::derived due to how C++ behaves, 
    // if it was possible... Kaboom!
    virtual int foo()   { return *ptr_; } 
};

<p>Now, I have a bunch of git repositories, for various projects, several of which are on github. I also have the SVN repository I mentioned, imported via the git-svn command..</p>

"37029","<p>It is generally accepted that the use of cursors in stored procedures should be avoided where possible (replaced with set based logic etc). If you take the cases where you need to iterate over some data, and can do in a read only manner, are fast forward (read only forward) cursor more or less inefficient than say while loops? From my investigations it looks as though the cursor option is generally faster and uses less reads and cpu time.  I haven't done any extensive testing, but is this what others find?  Do cursors of this type (fast forward) carry additional overhead or resource that could be expensive that I don't know about.</p>

"37248","<p>While the C# spec does include a pre-processor and basic directives (#define, #if, etc), the language does not have the same flexible pre-processor found in languages such as C/C++. I believe the lack of such a flexible pre-processor was a design decision made by Anders Hejlsberg (although, unfortunately, I can't find reference to this now). From experience, this is certainly a good decision, as there were some really terrible un-maintainable macros created back when I was doing a lot of C/C++. </p>

<p>That said, there are a number of scenarios where I could find a slightly more flexible pre-processor to be useful. Code such as the following could be improved by some simple pre-processor directives:</p>

<pre><code>public string MyProperty
{
  get { return _myProperty; }
  set
  {
    if (value != _myProperty)
    {
      _myProperty = value;
      NotifyPropertyChanged(""MyProperty"");
      // This line above could be improved by replacing the literal string with
      // a pre-processor directive like ""#Property"", which could be translated
      // to the string value ""MyProperty"" This new notify call would be as follows:
      // NotifyPropertyChanged(#Property);
    }
  }
}

<li><p><strong>Straight old Serialization using ObjectOutputStream and its various related classes</strong>: I'm not sold on it though since I find the data brittle.  Changing any object's structure breaks the serialized instances of it.  So I'm locked in to what seems to be a horrible versioning nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XML Serialization</strong>: It's not as brittle, but it's significantly slower that straight out serialization.  It can be transformed outside of my program.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaDB</strong>: I'd considered this since I'm comfortable writing JDBC applications. The difference here is that the database instance would only persist while the file was being opened or saved.

At any point while editing the data in the form the user can click one of the buttons on the form to perform certain actions.  By default the focus goes to the clicked button so the user has to click back on to the control they want to edit in order to continue modifying the data on the form.  What I need to be able to do is return the focus to the last edited control after the button click event has been processed.  Here's a sample screenshot that illustrates what I'm talking about:</p>

<p>The user can be entering data in textbox1, textbox2, textbox3, etc and click the button.  I need the button to return the focus back to the control that most recently had the focus before the button was clicked.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has a better way of implementing this functionality than what I've come up with.  Here's what I'm doing right now:</p>

<pre><code>   public partial class Form1 : Form
    {

<p>So basically what we have here is a class variable that points to the last entered control.  Each textbox on the form is setup so the textBox_Enter method is fired when the control receives the focus.  Then, when the button is clicked focus is returned to the control that had the focus before the button was clicked.  Anybody have any more elegant solutions for this?</p>

<p><strong>Approach #2:</strong> Use the bcmath extension, as this looks like something it was designed to tackle. My only worry in taking this approach is the scale setting of the bcmath extension, because there can't be any rounding errors in my 128-bit integers; they must be precise. I'm also worried about being able to eventually convert the result of the bcmath functions into a binary string (which I'll later need to shove into some mcrypt encryption functions).</p>

<p><strong>Approach #3:</strong> Store the numbers as binary strings (probably LSB first). Theoretically I should be able to store integers of any arbitrary size this way. All I would have to do is write the four basic arithmetic functions to perform add/sub/mult/div on two binary strings and produce a binary string result. This is exactly the format I need to hand over to mcrypt as well, so that's an added plus. This is the approach I think has the most promise at the moment, but the one sticking point I've got is that PHP doesn't offer me any way to manipulate the individual bits (that I know of). I believe I'd have to break it up into byte-sized chunks (no pun intended), at which point my questions about handling overflow/underflow from Approach #1 apply.</p>

"37398","<p>My current preferred C++ environment is the free and largely excellent Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express edition. From time to time I have sent release .exe files to other people with pleasing results. However recently I made the disturbing discovery that the pleasing results were based on more luck that I would like. Attempting to run one of these programs on an old (2001 vintage, not scrupulously updated) XP box gave me nothing but a nasty ""System cannot run x.exe"" (or similar) message.</p>

<p>Some googling revealed that with this toolset, even specifying static linking results in a simple hello-world.exe actually relying on extra .dll files (msvcm80.dll etc.). An incredibly elaborate version scheming system (manifest files anyone?) then will not let the .exe run without exactly the right .dll versions. I don't want or need this stuff, I just want an old fashioned self contained .exe that does nothing but lowest common denominator Win32 operations and runs on any old win32 OS.</p>

<p>Currently there are a few options I'm looking at, the <strong>most</strong> insane of which is some kind of samba share indexer that would generate a list of things shared on the various samba servers I tell it about and upload them to a website which could then be searched and browsed.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that the idea is obviously a couple of methods short of a class, do you chaps know of any way to link to samba file shares in html in a cross-browser way?

<p><strong>Some Clarifications</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>The computers used to access this website are a mixture of WIndows (XP) and Linux (Ubuntu) with a mixture of browsers (Opera and Firefox).</li>
<li>In linux entering smb://computer/share only seems to work in Nautilus (and presumably Konqueror / Dolphin for you KDE3.5/4 people). It doesn't work in Firefox or Opera (Firefox does nothing, Opera complains the URL is invalid).</li>
<li>I don't have a Windows box handy atm so I'm unsure if \\computer\share works in anything apart from IE (e.g. Firefox / Opera).</li>
<li>If you have a better idea for consolidating a bunch of random samba shares (it certainly can't get much worse than mine ;-)) it's worth knowing that there is no guarantee that any of the servers I would be wanting to index / consolidate would be up at any particular moment. Moreover, I wouldn't want the knowledge of what they have shared lost or hidden just because they weren't available. I would want to know that they share 'foo' but they are currently down.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, according to the Hibernate documentation ""Properties from superclasses not mapped as @MappedSuperclass are ignored.""</p>

<p>Well I think this means that if I have these two classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    private int foo;
}

@Entity
public class B extens A {
}
</code></pre>

<p>then field <code>foo</code> will not be mapped for class  B. Which makes sense. But if I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Problem {

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;

private String name;

public Long getId() {
    return id;
}

public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
}

private int levelOfUgliness;

    return levelOfUgliness;
}

public void setLevelOfUgliness(int levelOfUgliness) {
    this.levelOfUgliness = levelOfUgliness;
}
}

<p>I expect the class UglyProblem to have fileds <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> and both classes to be mapped using same table. (In fact, this is exactly what happens, I have just checked again). I have got this table:</p>

) AUTO_INCREMENT=2;

<p>Going back to my question:</p>

<p>I expect that because all other mapped fields are inherited and I do not see any reason to make this exception for ManyToOne relationships.</p>

<p>The application in question is a Java/J2EE based web app that uses Hibernate.  The way I currently have things working is that the Hibernate mapped model objects all implement a common ""Indexable"" interface that can return a set of key/value pairs that are recorded in Lucene.  Whenever a CRUD operation is performed involving such an object I send it via JMS queue into a message driven bean that records in Lucene the primary key of the object and the key/value pairs returned from the index( ) method of the Indexable object that was provided.  </p>

<p>My main worries about this scheme is if the MDB gets behind and can't keep up with the indexing operations that are coming in or if some sort of error/exception stops an object from being index.  The result is an out-of-date index for either a sort, or long, period of time.  </p>

<p>Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"" rel=""noreferrer"">LabVIEW</a> to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.</p>

<p>Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?</p>

<li>Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?</li>
<li>Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?</li>
<li>How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)</li>

"38501","<p>I'm trying to come up with a design for a thread pool with a lot of design requirements for my job. This is a real problem for working software, and it's a difficult task. I have a working implementation but I'd like  to throw this out to SO and see what interesting ideas people can come up with, so that I can compare to my implementation and see how it stacks up. I've tried to be as specific to the requirements as I can.</p>

<p>The thread pool needs to execute a series of tasks. The tasks can be short running (&lt;1sec) or long running (hours or days). Each task has an associated priority (from 1 = very low to 5 = very high). Tasks can arrive at any time while the other tasks are running, so as they arrive the thread pool needs to pick these up and schedule them as threads become available.</p>

<p>The task priority is completely independant of the task length. In fact it is impossible to tell how long a task could take to run without just running it.</p>

<p>Some tasks are CPU bound while some are greatly IO bound. It is impossible to tell beforehand what a given task would be (although I guess it might be possible to detect while the tasks are running).</p>

<p>The primary goal of the thread pool is to maximise throughput. The thread pool should effectively use the resources of the computer. Ideally, for CPU bound tasks, the number of active threads would be equal to the number of CPUs. For IO bound tasks, more threads should be allocated than there are CPUs so that blocking does not overly affect throughput. Minimising the use of locks and using thread safe/fast containers is important.</p>

<p>In general, you should run higher priority tasks with a higher CPU priority (ref: SetThreadPriority). Lower priority tasks should not ""block"" higher priority tasks from running, so if a higher priority task comes along while all low priority tasks are running, the higher priority task will get to run.</p>

<p>The tasks have a ""max running tasks"" parameter associated with them. Each type of task is only allowed to run at most this many concurrent instances of the task at a time. For example, we might have the following tasks in the queue:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
<li>B - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
<li>C - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
</ul>

<p>A working implementation could only run (at most) 1 A, 1 B and 1 C at the same time.</p>

<p>It needs to run on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista and Server 2008 (latest service packs).</p>

<p>For reference, we might use the following interface:</p>

{

"38598","<p>How are people unit testing their business applications? I've seen a lot of examples of unit testing with ""simple to test"" examples. Ex. a calculator. How are people unit testing data-heavy applications? How are you putting together your sample data? In many cases, data for one test may not work at all for another test which makes it hard to just have one test database?</p>

<p>Testing the data access portion of the code is fairly straightforward. It's testing out all the methods that work against the data that seem to be hard to test. For example, imagine a posting process where there is heavy data access to determine what is posted, numbers are adjusted, etc. There are a number of interim steps that occur (and need to be tested) along with tests afterwards that ensure the posting was successful. Some of those steps may actually be stored procedures.</p>

<p>In the past I've tried inserting the test data in a test database, then running the test, but honestly it's pretty painful to write this kind of code (and error prone). I've also tried just building a test database up front and rolling back the changes. That works OK but in a number of places you can't easily do this either (and many people would say that's integration testing; so be it, I still need to be able to test this somehow).</p>

<p>If the answer is that there isn't a nice way of handling this and it currently just sort of sucks, that would be useful to know as well.</p>

<li>On the server, decrypt the password using the key from the session and then destroy the session.</li>

<li>User: UserID (PK), FirstName, LastName</li>

However, this seems unnecessary since the only data being stored in the table is the relationship between the two primary tables, and this relationship itself can form a unique key.

I could also optionally add a two-column unique index (WidgetID, UserID) to the first table.</p>

Getting the data from the database and transforming it to XML which is then displayed on the different pages with XSL-templates.</p></li>

"39503","<p>I need to modify the MBR of Windows, and I would really like to do this from Windows.</p>

<p>Here are my questions. I know that I can get a handle on a physical device with a call to CreateFile. Will the MBR always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0? Also, I'm still learning the Windows API to read directly from the disk. Is readabsolutesectors and writeabsolutesectdors the two functions I'm going to need to use to read/write to the disk sectors which contain the MBR?</p>

<p>Edit from from what I've learned on my own.
The MBR will not always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0. Also, you can write to the bootsector (at least as Administrator on XP) by call CreateFile with the device name of the drive that contains the MBR. Also, you can write to this drive by simply calling WriteFile and passing the handle of the device created by calling CreateFile.</p>

<p>Edit to address Joel Coehoorn. 
I need to edit the MBR because I'm working on a project that needs to modify hardware registers after POST in BIOS, but before Windows will be allowed to boot. Our plan is to make these changes by modifying the bootloader to execute our code before Windows boots up. </p>

<p>Edit for Cd-MaN.
Thanks for the info. There isn't anything in your answer, though, that I didn't know and your answer doesn't address my question. The registry in particular absolutely will not do what we need for multiple reasons. The big reason being that Windows is the highest layer among multiple software layers that will be running with our product. These changes need to occur even before the lower levels run, and so the registry won't work. </p>

<p>P.S. for Cd-MaN.
As I understand it, the information you give isn't quite correct. For Vista, I think you can write to a volume if the sectors being written to are boot sectors. See <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448</a></p>

"40242","<p>I joined a new company about a month ago. The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong ""start-up"" feel to it. I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>

<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an ""oh no I don't like my job""-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>

<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>

<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap?

<p>Now, we can do this pretty easily by forcing the constructor to specify each of these properties.  But it's pretty easy to see how this can spiral out of control when you are forced to add more required fields to the Customer object.  </p>

<p>I've seen classes that take in 20+ arguments into their constructor and it's just a pain to use them.  But, alternatively, if you don't require these fields you run into the risk of having undefined information, or worse, object referencing errors if you rely on the calling code to specify these properties.</p>

<p>p.s. Just reading the first sectors of the hard disk isn't reveling anything. On my dev box I have two hard disks, and when I look at the contents of the first couple of sectors on either of the hard disks I have a standard boiler plate MBR.</p>

<p>Edit to clarify a few things.
The way I want to identify the device is with a string which will identify a physical disk drive (as opposed to a logical disk drive). Physical disk drives are of the form ""\\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx"" where x is a number. On the other hand, a logical drive is identified by a string of the form, ""\\.\x"" where x is a drive letter.</p>

<p>Edit to discuss a few of the ideas that were thrown out.
Knowing which logical volume Windows used to boot doesn't help me here. Here is the reason. Assume that C: is using a mirrored RAID setup. Now, that means we have at least two physical drives. Now, I get the mapping from Logical Drive to Physical Drive and I discover that there are two physical drives used by that volume. Which one did Windows use to boot? Of course, this is assuming that the physical drive Windows used to boot is the same physical drive that contains the MBR. </p>

<li>How to implement <a href=""http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#6.9"" rel=""noreferrer"">send and receive</a> (i.e. the Actor model)?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the pattern matching part, I've been looking into various projects like <a href=""http://members.cox.net/nelan/app.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">App</a> and <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/leunga/papers/research/prop/prop.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prop</a>.  These look pretty nice, but couldn't get them to work on a recent version (4.x) of g++.  The <a href=""http://felix-lang.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Felix</a> language also seems to support pattern matching pretty well, but isn't really C++.</p>

<p>As for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">Actor model</a>, there are existing implementations like ACT++ and <a href=""http://theron.ashtonmason.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Theron</a>, but I couldn't find anything but papers on the former<strike>, and the latter is single-threaded only</strike> [see answers].</p>

<p>Personally, I've implemented actors using threading and a thread-safe message queue.  Messages are hash-like structures, and used these together with a number of preprocessor macros to implemented simple pattern matching.</p>

<p>Right now, I can use the following code to send a message:</p>

<pre><code>(new Message(this))
    ->set(""foo"", ""bar"")
    ->set(""baz"", 123)
    ->send(recipient);
</code></pre>

<p>And the following to do simple pattern matching (<code>qDebug</code> and <code>qPrintable</code> are Qt-specific):</p>

<pre><code>receive_and_match(m)
    match_key(""foo"")    { qDebug(""foo: %s"", qPrintable(m->value(""foo"").toString())); }
    or_match_key(""baz"") { qDebug(""baz: %d"", m->value(""baz"").toInt()); }
    or_match_ignore

I've been looking at a few PHP framework recently, and it came down to two. The Zend Framework or CodeIgniter. </p>

<p>I prefer CodeIgniter, because of its simple design. It's very bare bone, and it is just kept simple. The thing I don't like though is the weak template system. The template system is important for me, because I will be working with another designer. Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>

<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis ""loose coupling between modules"", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any ""gotchas"" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here?</p>

<p>@<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41279/can-mac-os-xs-spotlight-be-configured-to-ignore-certain-file-types#41295"">diciu</a> That's an interesting answer. The problem in my case is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Figure out which importer handles your type of file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure if my type of file is handled by any single importer? Since they've all got weird extensions (.aux, .glo, .out, whatever) I think it's improbable that there's an importer that's <em>trying</em> to index them. But because they're plain text they're being picked up as generic files. (Admittedly, I don't know much about Spotlight's indexing, so I might be completely wrong on this.)</p>

<p><strong>Responses so far</strong><br>
1) Define scaling. Do you need to scale for lots of users, traffic, objects in a virtual environment?<br>
2) Look at your algorithms. Will the amount of work they do scale linearly with the actual amount of work - i.e. number of items to loop through, number of users, etc?<br>
3) Look at your hardware. Is your application designed such that you can run it on multiple machines if one can't keep up?  </p>

<p><strong>Secondary thoughts</strong><br>
1) Don't optimize too much too soon - test first. Maybe bottlenecks will happen in unforseen places.<br>
2) Maybe the need to scale will not outpace Moore's Law, and maybe upgrading hardware will be cheaper than refactoring.</p>

<p>Now whats confusing me is that we <em>KNOW</em> that the generic type is going to be of an Exception type due to the <em>where</em> clause. However, the code fails because we cannot implicitly cast <em>Exception</em> to <em>ExType</em>. We cannot explicitly convert it either, such as:</p>

"41479","<p>After discussion with colleagues regarding the use of the 'var' keyword in C# 3 I wondered what people's opinions were on the appropriate uses of type inference via var?</p>

<p>For example I rather lazily used var in questionable circumstances, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } // Type of 'item' not clear.
var something = someObject.SomeProperty; // Type of 'something' not clear.
var something = someMethod(); // Type of 'something' not clear.
</code></pre>

<p>More legitimate uses of var are as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // Obvious what l will be.
var s = new SomeClass(); // Obvious what s will be.
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly LINQ seems to be a bit of a grey area, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in dataContext.SomeTable
              select r; // Not *entirely clear* what results will be here.
</code></pre>

<p>It's clear what results will be in that it will be a type which implements IEnumerable, however it isn't entirely obvious in the same way a var declaring a new object is.</p>

<p>It's even worse when it comes to LINQ to objects, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from item in someList
              where item != 3
              select item;
</code></pre>

<p>This is no better than the equivilent foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } equivilent.</p>

<p>There is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type.</p>

<p><code>var</code> <em>does</em> maintain strong typing but the question is really whether it's dangerous for the type to not be immediately apparent on definition, something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong type to a method.</p>

<p>I'm a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in C++.  I know developers who see warnings in their C++ code and simply ignore them because they think they're just useless noise.

"41638","<p>The current system that I am working on makes use of Castle Activerecord to provide ORM (Object Relational Mapping) between the Domain objects and the database. This is all well and good and at most times actually works well!</p>

<p>The problem comes about with Castle Activerecords support for asynchronous execution, well, more specifically the SessionScope that manages the session that objects belong to. Long story short, bad stuff happens!</p>

<p>We are therefore looking for a way to easily convert (think automagically) from the Domain objects (who know that a DB exists and care) to the DTO object (who know nothing about the DB and care not for sessions, mapping attributes or all thing ORM).</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions on doing this. For the start I am looking for a basic One to One mapping of object. Domain object <strong>Person</strong> will be mapped to say <strong>PersonDTO</strong>. I do not want to do this manually since it is a waste.</p>

<p>Oh, I am working in C#, the ORM objects as said before a mapped with Castle ActiveRecord.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Example code:</h2>

<p>By @ajmastrean's request I have <a href=""http://www.fryhard.com/downloads/stackoverflow/ActiveRecordAsync.zip"" rel=""noreferrer"">linked</a> to an example that I have (badly) mocked together. The example has a <strong>capture form</strong>, capture form <strong>controller</strong>, <strong>domain</strong> objects, activerecord <strong>repository</strong> and an <strong>async</strong> helper. It is slightly big (3MB) because I included the ActiveRecored dll's needed to get it running. You will need to create a database called <em>ActiveRecordAsync</em> on your local machine or just change the .config file.</p>

<p>Basic details of example:</p>

<p><strong>The Capture Form</strong></p>

<p>The capture form has a reference to the contoller</p>

<pre><code>private CompanyCaptureController MyController { get; set; } 
</code></pre>

<p>On initialise of the form it calls MyController.Load()
    private void InitForm ()
    {
        MyController = new CompanyCaptureController(this);
        MyController.Load();
    }
This will return back to a method called LoadComplete()</p>

<pre><code>public void LoadCompleted (Company loadCompany)
{
    _context.Post(delegate
    {
         CurrentItem = loadCompany;
         bindingSource.DataSource = CurrentItem;
         bindingSource.ResetCurrentItem();
         //TOTO: This line will thow the exception since the session scope used to fetch loadCompany is now gone.
         grdEmployees.DataSource = loadCompany.Employees;
         }, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this is where the <em>""bad stuff""</em> occurs, since we are using the child list of Company that is set as Lazy load.</p>

<p><strong>The Controller</strong></p>

<p>The controller has a Load method that was called from the form, it then calls the Asyc helper to asynchronously call the LoadCompany method and then return to the Capture form's LoadComplete method.</p>

<pre><code>public void Load ()
{
    new AsyncListLoad&lt;Company&gt;().BeginLoad(LoadCompany, Form.LoadCompleted);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The LoadCompany() method simply makes use of the Repository to find a know company.</p>

<pre><code>public Company LoadCompany()
{
    return ActiveRecordRepository&lt;Company&gt;.Find(Setup.company.Identifier);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the example is rather generic, it has two domain classes which inherit from a base class, a setup file to instert some data and the repository to provide the <strong>ActiveRecordMediator</strong> abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to clarify the use case here: I currently store numbers in a single varchar field, and I leave them just as the customer entered them.  Then, when the number is needed by code, I normalize it.  The problem is that if I want to query a few million rows to find matching phone numbers, it involves a function, like</p>

<pre><code>where dbo.f_normalizenum(num1) = dbo.f_normalizenum(num2)

<p>People have made lots of good suggestions here, thanks! As an update, here is what I'm doing now: I still store numbers exactly as they were entered, in a varchar field, but instead of normalizing things at query time, I have a trigger that does all that work as records are inserted or updated.

<p>However, it does need to support inserts and updates as fast as possible. And since it is immutable, if I make a change to a node on the N'th level of the tree, I need to allocate at least N new nodes  in order to return the new tree.</p>

<p>My question is, would it be dramatically faster to pre-allocate nodes rather than create new ones every time the tree is modified? It would be fairly easy to do - keep a pool of several hundred unused nodes, and pull one out of the pool rather than create one whenever it was required for a modify operation. I can replenish the node pool when there's nothing else going on. (in case it isn't obvious, execution time is going to be much more at a premium in this application than heap space is)</p>

<p>Alternatively, does anyone know if an immutable DOM library already? I searched, but couldn't find anything.</p>

<p>*Note: For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept of immutability, it basically means that on any operation to an object that changes it, the method returns a copy of the object with the changes in place, rather than the changed object. Thus, if another thread is still reading the object it will continue to happily operate on the ""old"" version, unaware that changes have been made, rather than crashing horribly.

<p>Certain applications seem to have the Vista Aero look and feel to their caption bars and buttons even when running on Windows XP. (Google Chrome and  Windows Live Photo Gallery come to mind as examples.)  I know that one way to accomplish this from WinForms would be to create a borderless form and draw the caption bar/buttons yourself, then overriding <code>WndProc</code> to make sure moving, resizing, and button clicks do what they're supposed to do (I'm not clear on the specifics but could probably pull it off given a day to read documentation.)  I'm curious if there's a different, easier way that I'm overlooking.  Perhaps some API calls or window styles I've overlooked?</p>

I'm a little new to this, and have already run into a lot of issues trying to put together a good plan for dead reckoning and network latency, so I'd love to see some good literature on the topic.  I'll describe the methods I've considered.</p>

<p>Originally, I just sent the player's input to the server, simulated there, and broadcast changes in the game state to all players.  This made cheating difficult, but under high latency things were a little difficult to control, since you dont see the results of your own actions immediately.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19970919/aronson_01.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This GamaSutra article</a> has a solution that saves bandwidth and makes local input appear smooth by simulating on the client as well, but it seems to throw cheat-proofing out the window.  Also, I'm not sure what to do when players start manipulating the environment, pushing rocks and the like.  These previously neutral objects would temporarily become objects the client needs to send PDUs about, or perhaps multiple players do at once.  Whose PDUs would win?  When would the objects stop being doubly tracked by each player (to compare with the dead reckoned version)?  Heaven forbid two players engage in a sumo match (e.g. start pushing each other).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1370.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">This gamedev.net bit</a> shows the gamasutra solution as inadequate, but describes a different method that doesn't really fix my collaborative boulder-pushing example.

"42934","<p>It seems that everybody is jumping on the dynamic, non-compiled bandwagon lately.  I've mostly only worked in compiled, static typed languages (C, Java, .Net).  The experience I have with dynamic languages is stuff like ASP (Vb Script), JavaScript, and PHP.  Using these technologies has left a bad taste in my mouth when thinking about dynamic languages.  Things that usually would have been caught by the compiler such as misspelled variable names and assigning an value of the wrong type to a variable don't occur until runtime.  And even then, you may not notice an error, as it just creates a new variable, and assigns some default value.  I've also never seen intellisense work well in a dynamic language, since, well, variables don't have any explicit type.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, what people find so appealing about dynamic languages?  What are the main advantages in terms of things that dynamic languages allow you to do that can't be done, or are difficult to do in compiled languages.

"43199","<p>The login page in my Tapestry application has a property in which the password the user types in is stored, which is then compared against the value from the database. If the user enters a password with multi-byte characters, such as:</p>

<pre><code>áéíóú
</code></pre>

<p>...an inspection of the return value of getPassword() (the abstract method for the corresponding property) gives:</p>

<pre><code>Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, that's not encoded properly. Yet Firebug reports that the page is served up in UTF-8, so presumably the form submission request would also be encoded in UTF-8. Inspecting the value as it comes from the database produces the correct string, so it wouldn't appear to be an OS or IDE encoding issue.

<p>So why does Tapestry appear to botch the encoding when setting the property?</p>

<p>@Jan Soltis: Well, if I inspect the value that comes from the database, it displays the correct string, so it would seem that my editor, OS and database are all encoding the value correctly.

"43320","<p>One of the things that get me thoroughly confused is the use of <code>session.Flush</code>,in conjunction with <code>session.Commit</code>, and <code>session.Close</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes <code>session.Close</code> works, e.g., it commits all the changes that I need. I know I need to use commit when I have a transaction, or a unit of work with several creates/updates/deletes, so that I can choose to rollback if an error occurs.</p>

<p>But sometimes I really get stymied by the logic behind <code>session.Flush</code>. I have seen examples where you have a <code>session.SaveOrUpdate()</code> followed by a flush, but when I remove Flush it works fine anyway. Sometimes I run into errors on the Flush statement saying that the session timed out, and removing it made sure that I didn't run into that error.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good guideline as to where or when to use a Flush? I've checked out the NHibernate documentation for this, but I still can't find a straightforward answer.</p>

"43322","<p>Plug-in systems in C++ are hard because the ABI is not properly defined, and each compiler (or version thereof) follows its own rules. However, COM on Windows shows that it's  possible to create a minimal plug-in system that allows programmers with different compilers to create plug-ins for a host application using a simple interface.</p>

<p>Let's be practical, and leave the C++ standard, which is not very helpful in this respect, aside for a minute. If I want to write an app for Windows and Mac (and optionally Linux) that supports C++ plug-ins, and if I want to give plug-in authors a reasonably large choice of compilers (say less than 2 year old versions of Visual C++, GCC or Intel's C++ compiler), what features of C++ could I count on?</p>

<p>Of course, I assume that plug-ins would be written for a specific platform.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head, here are some C++ features I can think of, with what I think is the answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>vtable layout, to use objects through abstract classes? (yes)</li>
<li>built-in types, pointers? (yes)</li>
<li>structs, unions? (yes)</li>
<li>exceptions? (no)</li>
<li>extern ""C"" functions? (yes)</li>
<li>stdcall non-extern ""C"" functions with built-in parameter types? (yes)</li>
<li>non-stdcall non-extern ""C"" functions with user-defined parameter types? (no)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would appreciate any experience you have in that area that you could share. If you know of any moderately successful app that has a C++ plug-in system, that's cool too.</p>

"43324","<p>I'm using the Yahoo Uploader, part of the Yahoo UI Library, on my ASP.Net website to allow users to upload files. For those unfamiliar, the uploader works by using a Flash applet to give me more control over the FileOpen dialog.  I can specify a filter for file types, allow multiple files to be selected, etc. It's great, but it has the following documented limitation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of a known Flash bug, the Uploader running in Firefox in Windows does not send the correct cookies with the upload; instead of sending Firefox cookies, it sends Internet Explorer’s cookies for the respective domain. As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie to the upload request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if a user is using Firefox, I can't rely on cookies to persist their session when they upload a file. I need their session because I need to know who they are! As a workaround, I'm using the Application object thusly:</p>

<pre><code>Guid UploadID = Guid.NewGuid();
Application.Add(Guid.ToString(), User);
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm creating a unique ID and using it as a key to store the <code>Page.User</code> object in the Application scope. I include that ID as a variable in the POST when the file is uploaded. Then, in the handler that accepts the file upload, I grab the User object thusly:</p>

<pre><code>IPrincipal User = (IPrincipal)Application[Request.Form[""uploadid""]];
</code></pre>

<p>This actually works, but it has two glaring drawbacks: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If IIS, the app pool, or even just the application is restarted between the time the user visits the upload page, and actually uploads a file, their ""uploadid"" is deleted from application scope and the upload fails because I can't authenticate them.</p></li>
<li><p>If I ever scale to a web farm (possibly even a web garden) scenario, this will completely break. I might not be worried, except I do plan on scaling this app in the future.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have a better way? Is there a way for me to pass the actual ASP.Net session ID in a POST variable, then use that ID at the other end to retrieve the session?</p>

<p>I know I can get the session ID through <code>Session.SessionID</code>, and I know how to use YUI to post it to the next page. What I don't know is how to use that <code>SessionID</code> to grab the session from the state server.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm using a state server to store the sessions, so they persist application/IIS restarts, and will work in a web farm scenario.</p>

"43368","<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

"43808","<p>I have a distributed Java application running on 5 application servers. The servers all use the same Oracle 9i database running on a 6th machine.</p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sql prettyprint-override""><code>SELECT seq.nextval FROM dual;
ALTER SEQUENCE seq INCREMENT BY 100;
SELECT seq.nextval FROM dual;
</code></pre>

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.</p>

<li><p>The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?</p></li>

<li><strong><code>-y</code></strong> force file overwrite</li>
<li><strong><code>-ab &lt;bitrate&gt;</code></strong> set bitrate e.g. <em>-ab 96k</em></li>
<li><strong><code>-ar &lt;rate Hz&gt;</code></strong> set sampling rate e.g. <em>-ar 22050</em> for 22.05kHz</li>
<li><strong><code>-map_meta_data &lt;outfile&gt;:&lt;infile&gt;</code></strong> copy track metadata from infile to outfile</li>

<p>Thanks, Pete, I didn't know about that!</p>

<p>Scott, I'm working with very basic hosting packages that don't allow remote connections to the DB.  I don't know from the specs on RedGate (which I can't afford anyway) whether they provide a workaround for that, and although there are also API's out there (such as the one from Apex), I didn't see the point in investing in a solution that was still going to require more programming on my part. :)</p>

<p>My solution is to drop an ASPX page on the site that acts as a kind of ""schema service"", returning the collected metadata as XML.  I set up a little AJAX app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs.  It's not perfect, but a major step forward for me.</p>

For example, one common rule of thumb is that every table should have a primary key and that the key should be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key"" rel=""noreferrer"">devoid of information content</a>.  So I was wondering if anyone had written a book or published papers regarding design patterns for designing relational databases?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Gaius,</p>

<p>That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  </p>

<p>I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.</p>

<p>My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. </p>

<p>I think I came up with a solution to my problem, but it needs fleshing out. Here's what I'm thinking. I create a hidden form field called ""username"", and place within it the user's username, encrypted. Then, when the form POSTs, even though I don't receive any cookies from the browser, I know they're logged in because I can decrypt the hidden form  field and get the username.</p>

<p>The major security flaw I can see is replay attacks. How do I prevent someone from getting ahold of that encrypted string, and POSTing as that user? I know I can use SSL to make it harder to steal that string, and maybe I can rotate the encryption key on a regular basis to limit the amount of time that the string is good for, but I'd really like to find a bulletproof solution. Anybody have any ideas? Does the ASP.Net ViewState prevent replay? If so, how do they do it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'm hoping for a solution that doesn't require anything stored in a database. Application state would be okay, except that it won't survive an IIS restart or work at all in a web farm or garden scenario.

"44715","<p>Ruby setters—whether created by <code>(c)attr_accessor</code> or manually—seem to be the only methods that need <code>self.</code> qualification when accessed within the class itself.  This seems to put Ruby alone the world of languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>All methods need <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> (like Perl, and I think Javascript)</li>
<li>No methods require <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> is (C#, Java)</li>
<li>Only setters need <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> (Ruby?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best comparison is C# vs Ruby, because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance variables: <code>foo.x = y</code>, <code>y = foo.x</code> . C# calls them properties.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example; the same program in Ruby then C#:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def qwerty; @q; end                   # manual getter
  def qwerty=(value); @q = value; end   # manual setter, but attr_accessor is same 
  def asdf; self.qwerty = 4; end        # ""self."" is necessary in ruby?
  def xxx; asdf; end                    # we can invoke nonsetters w/o ""self.""
  def dump; puts ""qwerty = #{qwerty}""; end
end

a = A.new
a.xxx
a.dump
</code></pre>

<p>take away the <code>self.qwerty =()</code> and it fails (Ruby 1.8.6 on Linux &amp; OS X).  Now C#:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  int q;
  public int qwerty {
    get { return q; }
    set { q = value; }
  }
  public void asdf() { qwerty = 4; } // C# setters work w/o ""this.""
  public void xxx()  { asdf(); }     // are just like other methods
  public void dump() { Console.WriteLine(""qwerty = {0}"", qwerty); }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    a.xxx();
    a.dump();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Question: Is this true?  Are there other occasions besides setters where self is necessary? I.e., are there other occasions where a Ruby method <em>cannot</em> be invoked <em>without</em> self?</p>

<p>There are certainly lots of cases where self <em>becomes</em> necessary.  This is not unique to Ruby, just to be clear:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  public int test { get { return 4; }}
  public int useVariable() {
    int test = 5;
    return test;
  }
  public int useMethod() {
    int test = 5;
    return this.test;
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    Console.WriteLine(""{0}"", a.useVariable()); // prints 5
    Console.WriteLine(""{0}"", a.useMethod());   // prints 4
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Same ambiguity is resolved in same way.  But while subtle I'm asking about the case where </p>

<ul>
<li>A method <em>has</em> been defined, and</li>
<li><em>No</em> local variable has been defined, and</li>
</ul>

<p>we encounter</p>

<pre><code>qwerty = 4
</code></pre>

<p>which is ambiguous—is this a method invocation or an new local variable assignment?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Mike Stone</p>

<p>Hi!  I understand and appreciate the points you've made and your 
example was great.  Believe me when I say, if I had enough reputation,
I'd vote up your response.  Yet we still disagree: </p>

<ul>
<li>on a matter of semantics, and</li>
<li>on a central point of fact</li>
</ul>

<p>First I claim, not without irony, we're having a semantic debate about the 
meaning of 'ambiguity'.</p>

<p>When it comes to parsing and programming language semantics (the subject 
of this question), surely you would admit a broad spectrum of the notion 
'ambiguity'.  Let's just adopt some random notation: </p>

<ol>
<li>ambiguous: lexical ambiguity (lex must 'look ahead')</li>
<li>Ambiguous: grammatical ambiguity (yacc must defer to parse-tree analysis)</li>
<li>AMBIGUOUS: ambiguity knowing everything at the moment of execution</li>
</ol>

<p>(and there's junk between 2-3 too).  All these categories are resolved by 
gathering more contextual info, looking more and more globally.  So when you 
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is UNAMBIGUOUS in C#
  when there is no variable defined...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't agree more.  But by the same token, I'm saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is un-Ambiguous in ruby
  (as it now exists)</p>
  
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is Ambiguous in C#</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we're not yet contradicting each other.  Finally, here's where we really 
disagree: Either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further 
language constructs such that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For ""qwerty = 4,"" ruby UNAMBIGUOUSLY
  invokes an existing setter if there<br>
  is no local variable defined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say no.  I say yes; another ruby could exist which behaves exactly like 
the current in every respect, <em>except</em> ""qwerty = 4"" defines a new 
variable when no setter and no local exists, it invokes the setter if one 
exists, and it assigns to the local if one exists.  I fully accept that I 
could be wrong.  In fact, a reason why I might be wrong would be interesting.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>Imagine you are writing a new OO language with accessor methods looking
like instances vars (like ruby &amp; C#).  You'd probably start with 
conceptual grammars something like:</p>

<pre><code>  var = expr    // assignment
  method = expr // setter method invocation
</code></pre>

<p>But the parser-compiler (not even the runtime) will puke, because even after
all the input is grokked there's no way to know which grammar is pertinent.
You're faced which a classic choice.  I can't be sure of the details, but
basically ruby does this:</p>

<pre><code>  var = expr    // assignment (new or existing)
  // method = expr, disallow setter method invocation without .
</code></pre>

<p>that is why it's un-Ambiguous, while and C# does this:</p>

<pre><code>  symbol = expr // push 'symbol=' onto parse tree and decide later
                // if local variable is def'd somewhere in scope: assignment
                // else if a setter is def'd in scope: invocation
</code></pre>

<p>For C#, 'later' is still at compile time.</p>

<p>I'm sure ruby could do the same, but 'later' would have to be at runtime, because 
as ben points out you don't know until the statement is executed which case 
applies.</p>

<p>My question was never intended to mean ""do I really need the 'self.'?"" or ""what 
potential ambiguity is being avoided?""  Rather I wanted to know why was this
particular choice made?  Maybe it's not performance.  Maybe it just got the job
done, or it was considered best to always allow a 1-liner local to override a 
method (a pretty rare case requirement) ...</p>

<p>But I'm sort of suggesting that the most dynamical language might be the one which
postpones this decision the longest, and chooses semantics based on the most contextual 
info: so if you have no local and you defined a setter, it would use the setter.  Isn't 
this why we like ruby, smalltalk, objc, because method invocation is decided at runtime,
offering maximum expressiveness?</p>

<li>GUI programming (Though it might be impossible to get access to the
relevant code).</li>
<li>Common algorithms like sorting and searching.</li>
<li>Common collections (And integrating them with data manipulation
algorithms)</li>
</ul>

<p>Which other coding tasks are very common? I suspect a lot of the code being written is of the category of inventory management and otherwise tracking of real 'objects'.</p>

<p>As I have no industry experience I figured there might be a number of basic types of code which is done more often than I realize but which just doesn't materialize as external products.</p>

"45239","<p>Short version: What is the cleanest and most maintainable technique for consistant presentation and AJAX function across all browsers used by both web developers and web developers' end-users?</p>

<ul>
<li>IE 6, 7, 8</li>
<li>Firefox 2, 3</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Opera</li>
</ul>

<p>Long version: I wrote a <a href=""http://con.appspot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web app aimed at other web developers</a>. I want my app to support the major web browsers (plus Google Chrome) in both presentation and AJAX behavior.</p>

<p>I began on Firefox/Firebug, then added conditional comments for a consistent styling under IE 6 and 7.  Next, to my amazement, I discovered that jQuery does not behave identically in IE; so I <a href=""http://github.com/jhs/app-engine-console/commit/4fe7741ad1856208b565eeab4260a64933929c01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">changed my Javascript to be portable on FF and IE</a> using conditionals and less pure jQuery.</p>

<p>Today, I started testing on Webkit and Google Chrome and discovered that, not only are the styles inconsistant with both FF and IE, but Javascript is not executing at all, probably due to a syntax or parse error.  I expected some CSS work, but now I have more Javascript debugging to do!  At this point, I want to step back and think before writing piles of special cases for all situations.</p>

<p>I am <b>not looking for a silver bullet, just best practices</b> to keep things as understandable and maintainable as possible.  I prefer if this works with no server-side intelligence; however if there is a advantage to, for example, check the user-agent and then return different files to different browsers, that is fine if the total comprehensibility and maintainability of the web app is lower.  Thank you all very much!</p>

"45611","<p>I have a database with a few dozen tables interlinked with foreign keys. Under normal circumstances, I want the default <code>ON DELETE RESTRICT</code> behavior for those constraints.

"45879","<p>We have an InnoDB database that is about 70 GB and we expect it to grow to several hundred GB in the next 2 to 3 years. About 60 % of the data belong to a single table. Currently the database is working quite well as we have a server with 64 GB of RAM, so almost the whole database fits into memory, but we’re concerned about the future when the amount of data will be considerably larger. Right now we’re considering some way of splitting up the tables (especially the one that accounts for the biggest part of the data) and I’m now wondering, what would be the best way to do it.</p>

<p>The options I’m currently aware of are</p>

<ul>
<li>Using MySQL Partitioning that comes with version 5.1 </li>
<li>Using some kind of third party library that encapsulates the partitioning of the data (like hibernate shards)</li>
<li>Implementing it ourselves inside our application</li>
</ul>

<p>Our application is built on J2EE and EJB 2.1 (hopefully we’re switching to EJB 3 some day).</p>

<p>What would you suggest?</p>

<p>EDIT (2011-02-11):<br>
Just an update: Currently the size of the database is 380 GB, the data size of our ""big"" table is 220 GB and the size of its index is 36 GB. So while the whole table does not fit in memory any more, the index does.<br>
The system is still performing fine (still on the same hardware) and we're still thinking about partitioning the data.</p>

<p>EDIT (2014-06-04):
One more update: The size of the whole database is 1.5 TB, the size of our ""big"" table is 1.1 TB. We upgraded our server to a 4 processor machine (Intel Xeon E7450) with 128 GB RAM.
The system is still performing fine.
What we're planning to do next is putting our big table on a separate database server (we've already done the necessary changes in our software) while simultaneously upgrading to new hardware with 256 GB RAM.</p>

<p>This setup is supposed to last for two years. Then we will either have to finally start implementing a sharding solution or just buy servers with 1 TB of RAM which should keep us going for some time. </p>

<p>EDIT (2016-01-18):</p>

<p>We have since put our big table in it's own database on a separate server. Currently the size ot this database is about 1.9 TB, the size of the other database (with all tables except for the ""big"" one) is 1.1 TB.</p>

How do we implement the ""form"" part of this? I get how to expose ""read"" of our data by creating RESTful URLs that essentially function as method calls and return the data:</p>

<pre><code>GET /restapi/myobject?param=object-id-maybe

<p>...and an XML document representing some data structure is returned. Fine.</p>

"46030","<p>So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.</p>

<pre><code>CLass Blah

        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

        [DllImport(""User32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""ShowWindowAsync"")]
        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);
        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;

    public void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();
            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = ""FOO"";
            msgFrm.ShowDialog();
            msgFrm.BringToFront();
            msgFrm.TopMost = true;
            msgFrm.Activate();

            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? </p>

<hr>

<p>@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();
</code></pre>

<p>The form still comes up <em>under</em> the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.</p>

"46292","<p>I’m looking at rewriting a portion of our application in C# (currently legacy VB6 code). The module I am starting with is responsible for importing data from a variety of systems into our database.  About 5-6 times a year, a new client asks us to write a new import for the system that they use. Presently, this requires us to release a new version of our software for each new import option we add to the application. </p>

<p>One of the goals of the rewrite is to make the application support plug-ins. Every new import can become a separate assembly which the host application will recognize and allow the end user to interact with.  This will hopefully simplify life to some degree as we can simply drop a new assembly into the directory and have it be recognized and used by the main (host) application.</p>

<p>One of the items I am struggling with relates to the differences between the import options we currently support. In some cases we actually let the user point to a directory and read all of the files within the directory into our system. In other cases we allow them to point to a single file and import its contents. Additionally, some imports have a date range restriction that the user applies while others do not.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I design the application in a manner that allows for some flexibility among the imports we build and support while at the same time implementing a common interface that will allow the host application to easily recognize the plug-ins and the options that each one exposes to the user?</p>

Since we own the compiled, tested binaries as well as the source code, there's debate as to whether our consuming applications should use binary or project references.  </p>

<p>Some arguments in favor of project references:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project references would allow users to debug and view all solution code without the overhead of loading additional projects/solutions.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some arguments in favor of binary references:</p>

<ul>
<li>Binary references would simplify solutions and make for faster solution loading times.</li>
<li>Binary references would allow developers to focus on new code rather than potentially being distracted by code which is already baked and proven stable.</li>
<li>Binary references would force us to appropriately dogfood our stuff as we would be using the common library just as those outside of our organization would be required to do.</li>
<li>Since a binary reference can't be debugged (stepped into), one would be forced to replicate and fix issues by extending the existing test projects rather than testing and fixing within the context of the consuming application alone.  </li>
<li>Binary references will ensure that concurrent development on the class library project will have no impact on the consuming application as a stable version of the binary will be referenced rather than an influx version. It would be the decision of the project lead whether or not to incorporate a newer release of the component if necessary.</li>

  <p>Finally a short story for the record.
  In 1968, the Communications of the ACM
  published a text of mine under the
  title ""<em>The goto statement considered
  harmful</em>"", which in later years would
  be most frequently referenced,
  regrettably, however, often by authors
  who had seen no more of it than its
  title, which became a cornerstone of
  my fame by becoming a template: we
  would see all sorts of articles under
  the title ""X considered harmful"" for
  almost any X, including one titled
  ""Dijkstra considered harmful"". But
  what had happened? I had submitted a
  paper under the title ""<strong><em>A case against
  the goto statement</em></strong>"", which, in order
  to speed up its publication, the
  editor had changed into a ""letter to
  the Editor"", and in the process he had
  given it a new title of his own
  invention! The editor was Niklaus
  Wirth.</p>

Knuth. Reading both helps to reestablish context and a non-dogmatic understanding of the subject. In this paper, Dijkstra's opinion on this case is reported and is even more strong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Donald E. Knuth:</em> I believe that by presenting such a
  view I am not in fact disagreeing
  sharply with Dijkstra's ideas, since
  he recently wrote the following:
  ""Please don't fall into the trap of
  believing that I am terribly
  dogmatical about [the go to
  statement]. <strong>I have the uncomfortable
  feeling that others are making a

This polling will happen at repeating intervals - usually nightly, but can be configured to happen more (or less) frequently.

Now, I expect that in most use cases, there will be a domain, and the polling application can run as a service with Domain Admin (or equivalent) privileges, which means I do not have to worry about storing passwords - the admin setting up the app will define the service's username/password via standard Windows mechanisms.</p>

<p>But there's always a few black sheep out there. The program may run in nondomain environments, or in cases where some polled systems are not members of the domain.

"48322","<p>We have a few projects that involve building an application that is composed of maybe 50% custom functionality, but then pulls in, say, a wiki, a forum, and other components that are ""wheels"" that have already been invented that we do not wish to re-write from scratch.</p>

<p>These third-party applications usually have their own databases, themes, and authentication systems. Getting things to work like a single-sign-on, or a common theme, or tagging/searching across entities in multiple sub-apps are pretty challenging problems, in my experience. What are some of the best practices for this kind of integration project?</p>

<p>Our approach, so far, has been to try and pick your components carefully, choosing ones that have a clearly defined API, preferably via HTTP (like REST or SOAP), though that isn't always possible (we haven't found a decent forum that works that way). Are there suggestions folks can give to anyone trying to do this, as I suspect many of us are more and more frequently these days?</p>

Not a show stoper but I'm used to opening the front page of the site, there's a small login form, firefox' password manager already filled in the correct values, submit, done. One click.
Here - and it's currently the only site with openid I use - the password/form manager doesn't even fill in my ""login id"". I often close all browser windows and all cookies are erased - and I would like to keep it this way.</p>

<p>Are there any firefox plugins you would recommend that make the login process easier? Maybe something that checks my status at myOpenId and performs the login if necessary.</p>

Unfortunately RichQ is right and I can't use Seatbelt. And Sxipper ...not quite what I had in mind ;) Anyway, both solutions would take away some of the ""pain"", so upvotes for both of you.</p>

<li>Click ""login"" at stackoverflow
<li>Click on the ""select provider"" Button.
<li>Click on MyOpenId
<li>Enter Username
<li>Click ""Login"" (Sxipper could reduce the previous 4 steps to a single mouseclick)
<li>MyOpenId login page is loaded
<li>Click ""Sign in with an SSL certificate""
<li>Choose Certificate (grrr)
<li>Click ""Login"" (GRRR)
<li>Back to stackoverflow, finally.
</ul>

<p>What I really would like is:
<ul>
<li>Click ""login"" at stackoverflow
<li>My (only) LoginId is filled in
<li>Click ""Login""
<li>If necessary the certificate is chosen automagically, ssl login performed
<li>Back to stackoverflow without any further user interaction.

I know very well that estimating so far into the future regarding a problem-set of unknown size is not a good recipe for a successful estimate. However for a variety of reasons, a defined number of hours invariably gets assigned at the outset to this segment of work. And the farther off this initial estimate is from the real, final value, the more grief those involved with the debugging will have to take later on when they go ""over"" the estimate.</p>

<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.

<p>I think these can be stored using the <code>jQuery.data()</code> function:</p>

$('#foo').data('oldhoverin',???)

$('#foo').data('oldhoverout',???);

If the string matches one of the strings in search-list - we need to do some further processing of the thing (which is also irrelevant).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div onmouseover=""jsHoverIn('1')""
     onmouseout=""jsHoverOut('1')""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""image1"" /&gt;
    &lt;div id=""text1"" style=""display: none;""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some content&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some more content&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the javascript (It uses scriptaculous):</p>

<pre><code>function jsHoverIn(id) {
  if(!visible[id]) {
    new Effect.Fade (""image"" + id, {queue: { position: 'end', scope: id } });
    new Effect.Appear (""text"" + id, {queue: { position: 'end', scope: id } });
    visible[id] = true;
  }
}
function jsHoverOut (id) {
  var scope = Effect.Queues.get(id);
  scope.each(function(effect) { effect.cancel(); });

  new Effect.Fade (""text"" + id, {queue: { position: 'end', scope: id } });
  new Effect.Appear (""image"" + id, {queue: { position: 'end', scope: id } });
  visible[id] = false;
}

"49737","<p>Recently I was talking to a co-worker about C++ and lamented that there was no way to take a string with the name of a class field and extract the field with that name; in other words, it lacks reflection.  He gave me a baffled look and asked when anyone would ever need to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head I didn't have a good answer for him, other than ""hey, I need to do it right now"".  So I sat down and came up with a list of some of the things I've actually done with reflection in various languages.  Unfortunately, most of my examples come from my web programming in Python, and I was hoping that the people here would have more examples.  Here's the list I came up with:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given a config file with lines like<br>
x = ""Hello World!""<br>
y = 5.0<br>
dynamically set the fields of some <code>config</code> object equal to the values in that file.  (This was what I wished I could do in C++, but actually couldn't do.)</p></li>
<li><p>When sorting a list of objects, sort based on an arbitrary attribute given that attribute's name from a config file or web request.</p></li>
<li><p>When writing software that uses a network protocol, reflection lets you call methods based on string values from that protocol.  For example, I wrote an IRC bot that would translate<br>
<code>!some_command arg1 arg2</code><br>
into a method call <code>actions.some_command(arg1, arg2)</code> and print whatever that function returned back to the IRC channel.</p></li>
<li><p>When using Python's __getattr__ function (which is sort of like method_missing in Ruby/Smalltalk) I was working with a class with a whole lot of statistics, such as late_total.  For every statistic, I wanted to be able to add _percent to get that statistic as a percentage of the total things I was counting (for example, stats.late_total_percent).  Reflection made this very easy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So can anyone here give any examples from their own programming experiences of times when reflection has been helpful?  The next time a co-worker asks me why I'd ""ever want to do something like that"" I'd like to be more prepared.</p>

"49755","<p>I'm writing a structural modeling tool for a civil enginering application. I have one huge model class representing the entire building, which include collections of nodes, line elements, loads, etc. which are also custom classes. </p>

<p>I have already coded an undo engine which saves a deep-copy after each modification to the model. Now I started thinking if I could have coded differently. Instead of saving the deep-copies, I could perhaps save a list of each modifier action with a corresponding reverse modifier. So that I could apply the reverse modifiers to the current model to undo, or the modifiers to redo. </p>

<p>I can imagine how you would carry out simple commands that change object properties, etc. But how about complex commands? Like inserting new node objects to the model and adding some line objects which keep references to the new nodes.</p>

</p>

<p>Of course, that's pretty nonsensical, but I'm wondering whether any strict behaviour is defined. Opera effectively rejects the 'selected' attribute and selects the next item in the list. All other browsers appear to allow it, and it remains selected.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To clarify, I'm specifically interested in the initial selection. I'm dealing with one of those 'Select an item:'-type drop-downs, in which case the first option is really a label, and an action occurs <code>onchange()</code>. This is <em>fairly</em> well 'progressively enhanced', in that a submit button is present, and only removed via JavaScript. If the ""select..."" option were removed, whatever then were to become the first item would not be selectable. Are we just ruling out <code>onchange</code> drop downs altogether, or should the ""select..."" option be selectable, just with no effect?</p>
